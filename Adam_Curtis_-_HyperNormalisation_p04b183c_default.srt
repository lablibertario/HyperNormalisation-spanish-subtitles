Este documental te contará la historia de cómo llegamos a este extraño lugar.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.560
Trata de cómo, durante los últimos 40 años,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.640
políticos, financieros y utopistas tecnológicos,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.360
en vez de enfrentarse a las complejidades reales del mundo,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.160
simplemente se retiraron.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.400
En su lugar, construyeron una versión más simple del mundo

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.720
para mantenerse en el poder.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.560
Y como este falso mundo creció, todos nosotros crecimos con él,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640
porque la simplicidad era tranquilizante.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.840
Incluso aquellos que creían estar atacando al sistema

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.800
— los radicales, los artistas, los músicos,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.760
y toda nuestra contracultura —

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.800
en realidad se convirtieron en parte del engaño,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.480
porque ellos también se retiraron al mundo de la ficción,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.880
por eso su oposición no tiene efecto

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800

Pero la retirada a este mundo de sueños

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.640
permitió que fuerzas oscuras y destructivas crezcan y envenenen el mundo real.

La historia comienza en dos ciudades al mismo tiempo, en 1975.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800
Una es Nueva York.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.120
La otra es Damasco.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.680
Fue un momento cuando dos ideas sobre cómo podría ser posible

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.880
dirigir el mundo sin política, tomó lugar por primera vez.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.640
In 1975, New York City was on the verge of collapse.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.280
For 30 years, the politicians who ran the city

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.920
had borrowed more and more money from the banks

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.560
to pay for its growing services and welfare.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
But in the early '70s, the middle classes fled from the city

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.160
and the taxes they paid disappeared with them.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.560
So, the banks lent the city even more.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.240
But then, they began to get worried about the size of the growing debt

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.520
and whether the city would ever be able to pay it back.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.000
And then one day in 1975,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.440
the banks just stopped.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.280
The city held its regular meeting to issue bonds

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.680
in return for the loans, overseen by the city's financial controller.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.920
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.920
Today, the city of New York is offering for competitive bidding

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.360
the sale of 260 million tax anticipation notes,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.080
of which 100 million will mature on June 3rd, 1975.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.800
The banks were supposed to turn up at 11am,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.080
but it soon became clear that none of them were going to appear.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.000
The meeting was rescheduled for 2pm

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.640
and the banks promised they would turn up.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.640
The announcement on behalf of the controller is that the offer,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.040
which we had expected to receive

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400
and announce at two o'clock this afternoon,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.440
is now expected at four o'clock.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.200
Paul, does this mean that, so far, nobody wants those bonds?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200
We will be making a further announcement at four o'clock

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.640
and anything further that I could say now I think would not advance

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.440
the interest of the sale, which is now in progress.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.200
Does this mean that you have not been able to sell them so far today?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.920
We will have a further announcement at four o'clock.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.600
What happened that day in New York marked a radical shift in power.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.160
The banks insisted that in order to protect their loans

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.360
they should be allowed to take control of the city.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.000
The city appealed to the President,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.720
but he refused to help,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.000
so a new committee was set up to manage the city's finances.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.080
Out of nine members, eight of them were bankers.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.600
It was the start of an extraordinary experiment

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.120
where the financial institutions took power away from the politicians

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.040
and started to run society themselves.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.400
The city had no other option.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.160
The bankers enforced what was called "austerity" on the city,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.000
insisting that thousands of teachers, policemen

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.640
and firemen were sacked.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.920
This was a new kind of politics.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.360
The old politicians believed that crises were solved

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.560
through negotiation and deals.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.760
The bankers had a completely different view.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040
They were just the representatives

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.840
of something that couldn't be negotiated with -

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160
the logic of the market.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.440
To them, there was no alternative to this system.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.120
It should run society.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.880
Just by shifting paper around,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.640
these slobs can make 60 million, 65 million in a single transaction.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.080
That would take care of all of the lay-offs in the city,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.760
so it's reckless, it's cruel and it's a disgrace.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.520
There would be a fair number of bankers, of course,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.840
who'd say it's the unions who have been too greedy.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.000
- What would your reaction be to that?
- I guess they're right in a way.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.480
If you can make 60 million on a single transaction,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.760
and a worker makes 8,000, 9,000 a year, I suppose they're correct,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.240
and as they go back to their little estates in Greenwich, Connecticut,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.480
I want to wish them well, the slobs.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.440
But the extraordinary thing was no-one opposed the bankers.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.640
The radicals and the left-wingers who, ten years before,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.200
had dreamt of changing America through revolution did nothing.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.800
They had retreated

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.320
and were living in the abandoned buildings in Manhattan.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.800
The singer Patti Smith later described the mood of disillusion

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.000
that had come over them.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.240
"I could not identify

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.280
"with the political movements any longer," she said.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.840
"All the manic activity in the streets.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.720
"In trying to join them, I felt overwhelmed

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.240
"by yet another form of bureaucracy."

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.520
What she was describing was the rise of a new, powerful individualism

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.400
that could not fit with the idea of collective political action.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.240
Instead, Patti Smith and many others

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.880
became a new kind of individual radical,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.080
who watched the decaying city with a cool detachment.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.360
They didn't try and change it.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.000
They just experienced it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.760
Look at that. Isn't that cool?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.560
I love that, where, like, kids write all over the walls.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.440
That, to me, is neater than any art sometimes.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.520
"Jose and Maria forever."

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.400
Oh, there's a lot of things, like, when you pass by big movie houses,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.080
maybe we'll find one, but they have little movie screens,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.840
where you can see clips of, like, Z, or something like that.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.240
People watch it over and over.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.600
I've seen people, I've checked them out. All day!

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.800
I've gone back and forth and they're still there

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.880
watching the credits of a movie, cos they don't have enough dough,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880
but it's some entertainment, you know?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.520
Instead, radicals across America turned to art and music

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.560
as a means of expressing their criticism of society.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.760
They believed that instead of trying to change the world outside

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.520
the new radicalism should try and change

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.760
what was inside people's heads,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.400
and the way to do this was through self-expression,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.600
not collective action.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.320
U

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.960
V

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.400
W

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.000
X

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.960
Y

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.200
Z

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.480
But some of the Left saw that something else was really going on -

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.000
that by detaching themselves and retreating into an ironic coolness,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.280
a whole generation were beginning to lose touch

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.640
with the reality of power.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.680
Shut up.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.400
Shut up!

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320
One of them wrote of that time,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.080
"It was the mood of the era

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.440
"and the revolution was deferred indefinitely.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.160
"And while we were dozing, the money crept in."

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.960
SOBBING

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.560
What's your date of birth, Larry?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.600
But one of the people who did understand how to use this new power

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.760
was Donald Trump.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.400
Trump realised that there was now no future

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.040
in building housing for ordinary people,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.280
because all the government grants had gone.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.160
But he saw there were other ways

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
to get vast amounts of money out of the state.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.840
Trump started to buy up derelict buildings in New York

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.320
and he announced that he was going to transform them

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.920
into luxury hotels and apartments.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.560
But in return, he negotiated the biggest tax break

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.040
in New York's history, worth 160 million.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.480
The city had to agree because they were desperate,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.160
and the banks, seeing a new opportunity,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.560
also started to lend him money.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.160
And Donald Trump began to transform New York into a city for the rich,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.560
while he paid practically nothing.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.960
At the very same time, in 1975,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.680
there was a confrontation between two powerful men in Damascus,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.920
the capital of Syria.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.200
One was Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary of State.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.520
The other was the President of Syria, Hafez al-Assad.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.720
The battle between the two men

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.880
was going to have profound consequences for the world.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.280
And like in New York, it was going to be a struggle

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.960
between the old idea of using politics to change the world

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.200
and a new idea that you could run the world as a stable system.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.240
President Assad dominated Syria.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.560
The country was full of giant images and statues that glorified him.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.240
He was brutal and ruthless,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.280
killing or imprisoning anyone he suspected of being a threat.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.520
But Assad believed that the violence was for a purpose.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.480
He wanted to find a way of uniting the Arab countries

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.840
and using that power to stand up to the West.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.680
Four,

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.880
three,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.080
two,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.840
one.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.160
Kissinger was also tough and ruthless.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.800
He had started in the 1950s

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.720
as an expert in the theory of nuclear strategy.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.240
What was called "the delicate balance of terror."

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.760
It was the system that ran the Cold War.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.920
Both sides believed that if they attacked,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.360
the other side would immediately launch their missiles

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.480
and everyone would be annihilated.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.640
Kissinger had been one of the models for the character

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.360
of Dr Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick's film.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.080
Mr President, I would not rule out the chance

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.160
to preserve a nucleus of human specimens.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.840
It would be quite easy.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.120
At the bottom of some of our deeper mineshafts.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.920
Henry was not a warm, friendly, modest, jovial sort of person.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.480
He was thought of as one of the more...

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.920
..anxious, temperamental, self-conscious,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.400
ambitious, inconsiderate people at Harvard.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.920
Kissinger saw himself as a hard realist.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.920
He had no time for the emotional turmoil of political ideologies.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.400
He believed that history had always really been a struggle for power

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400
between groups and nations.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.320
But what Kissinger took from the Cold War

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.800
was a way of seeing the world as an interconnected system,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.480
and his aim was to keep that system in balance

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.360
and prevent it from falling into chaos.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.200
I believe that with all the dislocations we now experience,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.440
there also exists an extraordinary opportunity

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.080
to form, for the first time in history, a truly global society

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.080
carried up by the principle of interdependence,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.520
and if we act wisely, and with vision,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.040
I think we can look back to all this turmoil

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:42.240
as the birth pangs of a more creative and better system.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.640
If we miss the opportunity, I think there's going to be chaos.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.600
The flight has been delayed, we understand now.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.400
Kissinger will be arriving here about an hour and a half from now,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.720
so we'll just have the press informed

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.360
and then we'll stay in contact with you...

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.120
And it was this idea that Kissinger set out to impose

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.640
on the chaotic politics of the Middle East.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.440
But to manage it,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.280
he knew that he was going to have to deal with President Assad of Syria.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.920
President Assad was convinced that there would only ever be

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.080
a real and lasting peace between the Arabs and Israel

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.960
if the Palestinian refugees were allowed to return to their homeland.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.600
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.720
were living in exile in Syria,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.200
as well as in the Lebanon and Jordan.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.920
Have you found that the Palestinians here want to integrate

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.000
with the Syrians at all?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.440
Oh, no. No, never.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.800
They don't want...

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.400
Not here or neither in Lebanon or in Jordan, never.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.880
No, because they want to stay as a whole, as...Palestinian.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.240
As... They call themselves, "Those Who Go Back" -

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.040
"al-a'iduun", you say in Arabic.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.640
Assad also believed that such a peace

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.280
would strengthen the Arab world.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.680
But Kissinger thought that strengthening the Arabs

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.160
would destabilise his balance of power.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.640
So, he set out to do the very opposite -

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.640
to fracture the power of the Arab countries,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.800
by dividing them and breaking their alliances,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.200
so they would keep each other in check.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.040
Kissinger now played a double game.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.080
Or as he termed it, "constructive ambiguity".

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.400
In a series of meetings, he persuaded Egypt

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.520
to sign a separate agreement with Israel.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.240
But at the same time, he led Assad to believe

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.000
that he was working for a wider peace agreement,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.440
one that WOULD include the Palestinians.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.400
In reality, the Palestinians were ignored.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.080
They were irrelevant to the structural balance

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.560
of the global system.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.400
The hallmark of Kissinger's thinking about international politics

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.800
is its structural design.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.240
Everything is always connected in his mind to everything else.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.120
But his first thoughts are on that level,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.240
on this structural global balance of power level.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.800
And as he addresses questions of human dignity,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.440
human survival, human freedom...

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.680
..I think they tend to come into his mind

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.480
as an adjunct of the play of nations at the power game.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.160
When Assad found out the truth, it was too late.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.520
In a series of confrontations with Kissinger in Damascus,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.160
Assad raged about this treachery.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.680
He told Kissinger that what he had done

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.640
would release demons hidden under the surface of the Arab world.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.280
Kissinger described their meetings.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.160
"Assad's controlled fury," he wrote,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.640
"was all the more impressive for its eerily cold,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.840
"seemingly unemotional, demeanour."

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.040
Assad now retreated.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.880
He started to build a giant palace that loomed over Damascus...

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.800
..and his belief that it would be possible to transform the Arab world

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.160
began to fade.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.440
A British journalist, who knew Assad, wrote...

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.880
"Assad's optimism has gone.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.760
"A trust in the future has gone.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.800
"What has emerged instead is a brutal, vengeful Assad,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.680
"who believes in nothing except revenge."

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.280
The original dream of the Soviet Union

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.040
had been to create a glorious new world.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.200
A world where not only the society,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.920
but the people themselves would be transformed.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.440
They would become new and better kinds of human beings.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.560
But by the 1980s, it was clear that the dream had failed.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.560
WOMAN GASPS

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.440
WOMAN SPEAKS RUSSIAN

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.840
The Soviet Union became instead

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.160
a society where no-one believed in anything

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.960
or had any vision of the future.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.720
RUSSIAN SONG PLAYS

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.360
Those who ran the Soviet Union had believed that they could plan

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.200
and manage a new kind of socialist society.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.600
But they had discovered that it was impossible

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.440
to control and predict everything

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.840
and the plan had run out of control.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.240
But rather than reveal this, the technocrats began to pretend

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.440
that everything was still going according to plan.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.480
And what emerged instead was a fake version of the society.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.040
The Soviet Union became a society where everyone knew

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.760
that what their leaders said was not real

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.960
because they could see with their own eyes

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.000
that the economy was falling apart.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.160
But everybody had to play along and pretend that it WAS real

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.080
because no-one could imagine any alternative.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.280
One Soviet writer called it "hypernormalisation".

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.560
You were so much a part of the system

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.880
that it was impossible to see beyond it.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.360
The fakeness was hypernormal.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.720
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT IN RUSSIAN

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.360
In this stagnant world, two brothers -

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.120
called Arkady and Boris Strugatsky -

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.480
became the inspiration of a growing new dissident movement.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.080
They weren't politicians, they were science fiction writers,

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.480
and in their stories,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.720
they expressed the strange mood that was rising up

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.600
as the Soviet Empire collapsed.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.920
Their most famous book was called Roadside Picnic.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.680
It is set in a world that seems like the present,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.160
except there is a zone that has been created by an alien force.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.680
People, known as "stalkers", go into the zone.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.480
They find that nothing is what it seems,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.760
that reality changes minute by minute.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.960
Shadows go the wrong way.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.680
There are hidden forces that twist your body

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.760
and change the way you think and feel.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360
The picture the Strugatskys gave

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.760
was of a world where nothing was fixed.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.000
Where reality - both what you saw and what you believed -

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.280
had become shifting and unstable.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.840
And in 1979, the film director Andrei Tarkovsky

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.920
made a film that was based on Roadside Picnic.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.720
He called it Stalker.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.840
WIND WHISTLES

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.360
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.080
..That I will faithfully execute

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.840
the office of president of the United States.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.320
..that I will faithfully execute

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.800
the office of president of the United States.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.320
The new president of America had a new vision of the world.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.840
It wasn't the harsh realism of Henry Kissinger any longer,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.560
it was different -

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.240
it was a simple, moral crusade,

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.240
where America had a special destiny to fight evil

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.320
and to make the world a better place.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.280
The places and the periods in which man has known freedom

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.640
are few and far between -

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.400
just scattered moments on the span of time.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.960
And most of those moments have been ours.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.920
The American people have a genius for great and unselfish deeds.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.080
Into the hands of America,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.560
God has placed the destiny of an afflicted mankind.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.600
God bless America.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.400
But this crusade was going to lead Reagan

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.680
to come face-to-face with Henry Kissinger's legacy...

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.360
..and, above all, the vengeful fury of President Assad of Syria.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.080
EXPLOSION Israel was now determined

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.960
to finally destroy the power of the Palestinians.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.440
And, in 1982, they sent a massive army

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.320
to encircle the Palestinian camps in the Lebanon.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.960
Do you know... Do you know how strong the Israelis are?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.080
Do you know how many tanks they have outside Beirut?

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.760
Do you know how strong they are?

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.320
HE TRANSLATES

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.240
That means "We are not ready to surrender".

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.320
Young, young, young!

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.640
NEARBY EXPLOSIONS

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.400
Keep going!

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.880
Dashed into this building here because the PLO guys with us

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.640
expect that, sooner or later, there will be a huge explosion.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.080
There've been several of these in the last few minutes.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.160
As you can see,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.720
there's enormous damage in all the buildings round here.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.600
EXPLOSION

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.440
Quick, quick!

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.240
DISTANT EXPLOSIONS

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.600
Two months later, thousands of Palestinian refugees

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.400
were massacred in the camps.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.960
It horrified the world.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.920
But what was even more shocking

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.240
was that Israel had allowed it to happen.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.120
Its troops had stood by and watched

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.600
as a Christian Lebanese faction murdered the Palestinians.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.800
This was the first of the massacres we discovered yesterday.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.720
Now, 24 hours later, the stench here is appalling.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.160
But the effects on the Israelis

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.240
of what their Christian allies did here

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.480
and in dozens of other places around this camp

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.160
are going to be immense.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.480
There's always been a risk of such massacres if Christian militiamen

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.960
were allowed to come into Palestinian camps,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.920
and the Israelis seem to have done nothing

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.800
to prevent them coming into this one.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.680
In the face of the horror and the growing chaos,

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.920
President Reagan was forced to act.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.600
He announced that American marines would come to Beirut

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.400
to lead a peacekeeping force.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.520
Reagan insisted that the troops were neutral.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.360
But President Assad was convinced that there was another reality.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.240
He saw the troops as part of the growing conspiracy

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.200
between America and Israel to divide the Middle East into factions

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.440
and destroy the power of the Arabs.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.480
Assad decided to get the Americans out of the Middle East.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.760
And to do this, he made an alliance

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.680
with the new revolutionary force of Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.800
And what Khomeini could bring to Assad

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.120
was an extraordinary new weapon that he had just created.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.480
It was called it "the poor man's atomic bomb".

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.760
CHANTING:

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.480
Ayatollah Khomeini had come to power two years before

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.200
as the leader of the Iranian revolution.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.320
But his hold on power was precarious,

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.360
and Khomeini had developed a new idea of how to fight his enemies

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.880
and defend the revolution.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.800
Khomeini told his followers that they could destroy themselves

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.080
in order to save the revolution providing that, in the process,

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.080
they killed as many enemies around them as possible.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.080
This was completely new,

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.160
because the Koran specifically prohibited suicide.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.600
In the past, you became a martyr on the battlefield

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.520
because God chose the time and place of your death.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.920
But Khomeini changed this.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.120
He did it by going back to one of the central rituals of Shia Islam.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.600
MUSIC PLAYS

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.200
Every year, Shi'ites march in a procession

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.920
mourning the sacrifice of their founder, Husayn.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.320
As they do, they whip themselves,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.120
symbolically re-enacting Husayn's suffering.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.920
Khomeini said that the ultimate act of penitence

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.120
was not just to whip yourself,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.480
but to kill yourself...

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.080
..providing it was for the greater good of the revolution.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.120
In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.520
good afternoon.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.360
"An Iraqi Soviet-made MiG-23 was shot down

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.480
"by the air-force jet fighters of the Islamic Republic

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.240
"over the north-western Iranian border region of Marivan

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.840
"at 10.08 hours local time, Saturday,"

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.280
said the Joint Staff Commands communique numbered 1710.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.600
Khomeini had mobilised this force

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.440
when the country was attacked by Iraq.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.920
Iran faced almost certain defeat

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.520
because Iraq had far superior weapons,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.440
many of them supplied by America.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.560
So, the revolutionaries took tens of thousands of young boys

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.960
out of schools, put them on buses and sent them to the front line.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.920
CHANTING

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.480
Their job was to walk through the enemies' minefields,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.680
deliberately blowing themselves up in order to open gaps

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.120
that would allow the Iranian army to pass through unharmed.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.680
It was organised suicide on a vast scale.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.720
This human sacrifice was commemorated

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.200
in giant cemeteries across the country.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.960
Fountains flowing with blood red-water

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.280
glorified this new kind of martyrdom.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.680
And it was this new idea -

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.240
of an unstoppable human weapon -

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.560
that President Assad took from Khomeini,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.800
and brought to the West for the first time.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.480
But, as it travelled,

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.280
it would mutate into something even more deadly.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.600
Instead of just killing yourself,

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.880
you would take explosives with you into the heart of the enemy

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.760
and then blow yourself up,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.480
taking dozens or even hundreds along with you.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.280
It would become known as "suicide bombing".

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.800
In October 1983, two suicide bombers

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.920
drove trucks into the US marine barracks in Beirut.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.000
It was seeing something move that took me out of my trance.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.920
And then I recognised, "Oh, yes, marines were in that building.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.640
"A lot of marines were in that building."

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.520
And that's when I ran down and...

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.640
And it was a black... black marine.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.920
He looked white.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.880
The dust had just covered him.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.560
The massive explosions killed 241 Americans.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.640
The bombers were members of a new militant group

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.080
that no-one had heard of.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.520
They called themselves Hezbollah

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.760
and, although many of them were Iranian,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.880
they were very much under the control of Syria

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.360
and the Syrian intelligence agencies.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.360
President Assad was using them as his proxies to attack America.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.680
Whoever carried out yesterday's bombings - Shia Muslim fanatics,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.520
devotees of the Ayatollah Khomeini, or whatever -

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.320
it is Syria who profits politically.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.840
The most significant fact is that the dissidents live and work

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.280
with Syrian protection.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.640
So, it is to Syria rather than to the dissident group's guiding light,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.240
Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, that we must look for an explanation

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.000
of the group's activities. Destabilisation is Syria's

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.120
Middle-Eastern way of reminding the world that Syria

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.600
must not be left out of plans for the future of the area.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.240
There are no words that can express our sorrow and grief

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.360
for the loss of those splendid young men

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.960
and the injury to so many others.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.000
These deeds make so evident the bestial nature

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.920
of those who would assume power

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.920
if they could have their way and drive us out of that area.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.200
But despite his words, within four months,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.240
President Reagan withdrew all the American troops from the Lebanon.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.520
The Secretary of State George Shultz explained.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.000
"We became paralysed by the complexity that we faced," he said.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.000
So, the Americans turned and left.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.360
For President Assad, it was an extraordinary achievement.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.640
He was the only Arab leader to have defeated the Americans

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.000
and forced them to leave the Middle East.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.040
He had done it by using the new force of suicide bombing.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.800
A force that, once unleashed,

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.560
was going to spread with unstoppable power.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.520
But at this point, both Assad and the Iranians

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.560
thought that they could control it.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.480
And what gave it this extraordinary power

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.160
was that it held out the dream

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.760
of transcending the corruptions of the world

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.680
and entering a new and better realm.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.640
- TRANSLATION:
- One should defend the realm of Islam and Muslims

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.320
against heretics and invaders.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.120
And to fulfil this duty, one should even sacrifice one's life.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.640
We believe that martyrs can overlook our deeds from the other world.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.880
It means that, after death,

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.400
the martyr lives and can still witness this world.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.040
By the middle of the 1980s, the banks were rising up

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.680
and becoming ever more powerful in America.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.360
What had started ten years before in New York,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.880
the idea that the financial system could run society,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.240
was spreading.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.000
But unlike older systems of power, it was mostly invisible.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.520
A writer called William Gibson

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.600
tried to dramatise what was happening

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.520
in a powerful, imaginative way, in a series of novels.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.680
Gibson had noticed how the banks and the new corporations

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.960
were beginning to link themselves together through computer systems.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.760
What they were creating was a series of giant networks of

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.280
information that were invisible to ordinary people

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.520
and to politicians.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.560
But those networks gave the corporations

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.040
extraordinary new powers of control.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.920
'Good morning. South-West Development. May I help you?'

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.760
Gibson gave this new world a name.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.880
He called it "cyberspace"

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.920
and his novels described a future that was dangerous and frightening.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.360
Hackers could literally enter into cyberspace and as they did,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.200
they travelled through systems that were so powerful

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.480
that they could reach out and crush intruders by destroying their minds.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:16.000
In cyberspace, there were no laws and no politicians to protect you.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.520
Just raw, brutal corporate power.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.400
But then, a strange thing happened.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.840
A new group of visionaries in America

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.600
took Gibson's idea of a hidden, secret world

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.720
and transformed it into something completely different.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.080
They turned it into a dream of a new utopia.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.800
They were the technological utopians who were rising up

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.880
on the West Coast of America.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.160
They turned Gibson's idea on its head.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.880
Instead of cyberspace being a frightening place,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.440
dominated by powerful corporations,

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.920
they reinvented it as the very opposite.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.120
A new, safe world where radical dreams could come true.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.320
Ten years before, faced by the complexity of real politics,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.280
the radicals had given up on the idea of changing the world.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.400
But now, the computer utopians saw, in cyberspace,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.560
an alternative reality.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.000
A place they could retreat to away from the harsh right-wing politics

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.480
that now dominated Reagan's America.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.160
The roots of this vision lay back in the counterculture

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.320
of the 1960s, and, above all, with LSD.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.280
We've got some more acid over here if you want to go ahead.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.800
Many of those who had taken LSD in the '60s

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.320
were convinced that it was more than just another drug,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.280
that it opened human perception

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.480
and allowed people to see new realities

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.560
that were normally hidden from them.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.920
See, the ones that have white in them are really great.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.200
SHE GIGGLES

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.160
I feel like a rabbit.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.120
It freed them from the narrow, limited view of the world

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.840
that was imposed on them by politicians and those in power.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.400
In the United States, in the next, five, ten, 15 years,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.840
you're going to see more and more people taking LSD and making it

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.400
a part of their lives, so there will be an LSD country within 15 years.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.480
An LSD society, there will be less interest

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.560
in, obviously, warfare,

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.200
in power politics.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.720
You know, politics today is a disease, it's a real addiction.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.520
Politics, politics, politics, politics.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.840
Don't politick, don't vote - these are old men's games.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.600
Impotent and senile old man that want to put you

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.240
onto their old chess games of war and power.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.920
20 years later, the new networks of machines seemed to offer

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.880
a way to construct a real alternate reality.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.400
Not just one that was chemically induced,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.480
but a space that actually existed

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.120
in a parallel dimension to the real world.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.680
And like with acid,

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.560
cyberspace could be a place where you would be liberated from the old,

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.760
corrupt hierarchies of politics and power and explore new ways of being.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.640
One of the leading exponents of this idea was called John Perry Barlow.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.600
In the '60s, he had written songs for the Grateful Dead

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.440
and been part of the acid counterculture.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.120
Now, he organised what he called "cyberthons",

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.280
to try and bring the cyberspace movement together.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.320
Well, you know, the cyberthon as it was originally conceived

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.880
was supposed to be...

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.880
..the '90s equivalent of the acid test

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.040
and we had thought to involve some of the same personnel.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.840
- You and I and Timmy should sit down and talk.
- OK. That is good.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.640
And it immediately acquired a financial quality

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.600
or a commercial quality that was initially

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.560
a little unsettling to an old hippy like me,

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.160
but as soon as I saw it actually working, then I thought,

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.480
"Ah, well, if you're going to have an acid test for the '90s,

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.920
"money better be involved."

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.840
Instead of having a glass barrier that separates you -

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.640
your mind - from the mind of the computer,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.560
the computer pulls us inside and creates a world for us.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.880
Incorporates everything that could be incorporated.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.240
It incorporates experience itself.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.960
Barlow then wrote a manifesto

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.560
that he called A Declaration Of Independence Of Cyberspace.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.800
It was addressed to all politicians,

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.560
telling them to keep out of this new world.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.880
It was going to be incredibly influential,

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.240
because what Barlow did was give a powerful picture of the internet

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.640
not as a network controlled by giant corporations,

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.240
but, instead, as a kind of magical, free place.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.040
An alternative to the old systems of power.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.440
It was a vision that would come to dominate the internet

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.520
over the next 20 years.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.320
Governments of the industrial world,

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.240
cyberspace does not lie within your borders.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.840
We are creating a world where anyone,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.760
anywhere, may express his or her beliefs,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.040
no matter how singular,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.920
without fear of being coerced

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.720
into silence or conformity.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.160
I declare the global social space we are building

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.760
to be naturally independent

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.440
of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.520
We will create a civilisation of the mind in cyberspace.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.560
May it be more humane and fair

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.400
than the world your governments have made before.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.040
It's begun.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.040
This is the key to a new order.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.080
This code disk means freedom.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.080
But two young hackers in New York thought that Barlow

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.840
was describing a fantasy world,

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.320
that his vision bore no relationship at all

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.400
to what was really emerging online.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.400
They were cult figures on the early online scene

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.960
and their fans followed and recorded them.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.840
They called themselves Phiber Optik and Acid Phreak

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.080
and they spent their time exploring and breaking in

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.880
to giant computer networks that they knew

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.120
were the hard realities of modern digital power.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.480
My specific instance, I was charged with conspiracy

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.720
to commit a few dozen "overacts", they called them.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.160
Among a number of things having to do with computer trespass and...

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.600
and I guess computer eavesdropping, interception.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.680
Unauthorised access to federal interest computers,

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.960
which is pretty vague law.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.800
Communications network computers and so on.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.320
In a notorious public debate online, the two hackers attacked Barlow.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.600
What infuriated them most was Barlow's insistence

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.480
that there was no hierarchy

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.560
or controlling powers in the new cyber world.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.680
The hackers set out to demonstrate that he was wrong.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.920
Acid Phreak hacked into the computers of

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.720
a giant corporation called TRW.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.360
TRW had originally built the systems

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.240
that ran the Cold War for the US military.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.760
They had helped create the delicate balance of terror.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.960
Now, TRW had adapted their computers to run a new system,

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.040
that of credit and debt.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.200
Their computers gathered up the credit data of millions of Americans

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.360
and were being used by the banks to decide individuals' credit ratings.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.320
The hackers broke into the TRW network,

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.680
stole Barlow's credit history and published it online.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.520
The hackers were demonstrating the growing power of finance.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.120
How the companies that ran the new systems of credit

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.080
knew more and more about you,

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.480
and, increasingly, used that information to control your destiny.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.320
But the system that was allowing this to happen

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.920
were the new giant networks of information

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.200
connected through computer servers.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.080
The hackers were questioning whether Barlow's utopian rhetoric

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.000
about cyberspace might really be a convenient camouflage

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.720
hiding the emergence of a new and growing power

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.120
that was way beyond politics.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.520
But cyberspace was not the only imaginary story being created.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.640
Faced with the humiliating defeat in the Lebanon,

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.800
President Reagan's government was desperate to shore up

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.080
the vision of a moral world

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.920
where a good America struggled against evil.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:11.240
And to do this they were going to create a simple villain.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.800
An imaginary enemy, one that would free them

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.880
from the paralysing complexity of real Middle-Eastern politics.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.960
The perfect candidate was waiting in the wings.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.920
Colonel Gaddafi, the ruler of Libya.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.720
The Americans were going to ruthlessly use Colonel Gaddafi

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.440
to create a fake terrorist mastermind.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.760
And Gaddafi was going to happily play along,

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:49.040
because it would turn him into a famous global figure.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.560
Colonel Gaddafi had taken power in a coup in the 1970s

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.480
but from the very start,

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.480
he was convinced that he was more than just the leader of one country.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.880
He believed that he was an international revolutionary

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.240
whose destiny was to challenge the power of the West.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.400
Gentlemen, the Queen.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.440
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN PLAYS

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.040
When he was a young officer,

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.760
Gaddafi had been sent to England for training

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.120
and he had detested the patronising racism

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.640
that he said he had found at the heart of British society.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.200
Yes, I attended a course.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:53:00.040
I had been in England in 1966 from February to August.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.560
You had the best months.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.000
HE CHUCKLES

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
I was in Beaconsfield,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.360
a village called Beaconsfield,

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.640
in an army school.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:22.120
In fact, we were ill-treated in that place from some British officers.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:30.200
I think the officers were Jews,

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.880
maybe Jews.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.160
Ill-treated in what sort of way?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.760
In many ways.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.760
They ill-treat us every time.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.480
By being rude or by bullying or...?

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:57.120
In their own behaviour towards us, they ill-treated us.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.440
They hate us in there

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.480
because of colonisation.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.280
It is the result of colonising.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.960
Once in power, Gaddafi had developed his own revolutionary theory,

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.120
which he called the Third Universal Theory.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.040
It was an alternative, he said, to communism and capitalism.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.920
He published it in a green book,

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.960
but practically no-one read it.

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.160
He had sent money and weapons to the IRA in Ireland

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.440
to help them overthrow the British ruling class.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:37.800
But all the other Arab leaders rejected him and his ideas.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.600
They thought that he was mad.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.200
And by the mid-1980s, Gaddafi was an isolated figure

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.520
with no friends and no global influence.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.440
Then, suddenly, that changed.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.400
In December 1985,

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.960
terrorists attacked Rome and Vienna airports simultaneously,

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.880
killing 19 people,

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.640
including five Americans.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.680
There was growing pressure on President Reagan to retaliate.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.160
It's time to rename your State Department

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.240
the Capitulation Department.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.200
Get off of your stick, Mr President.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.960
The American people are sick and tired of being kicked around.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.560
You talk tough,

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.560
let's see you use some of these billions and billions

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.760
and billions of dollars' worth of weapons

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.720
that you've asked us to approve.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.960
Your words are cheap talk.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.160
President Reagan immediately announced

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.880
that Colonel Gaddafi was definitely behind the attacks.

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.640
These murderers could not carry out their crimes

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.800
without the sanctuary and support

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.320
provided by regimes such as Colonel Gaddafi's in Libya.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.480
The Rome and Vienna murders are only the latest

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:54.360
in a series of brutal terrorist acts committed with Gaddafi's backing.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.080
But the European security services who investigated the attacks

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.200
were convinced that Libya was not involved at all

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.400
and that the mastermind behind the attacks was, in fact, Syria -

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.960
that the terrorists had been directed

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.160
by the Syrian intelligence agencies.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.720
But the Americans say that the attack at Rome Airport

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:20.280
was organised by Gaddafi, not by Damascus. What do you say?

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.680
- No, we don't have any evidence...
- You have no evidence?

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.840
..supporting such an...affirmation.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.800
The only evidence we have

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.040
shows a Syrian connection.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.480
You say that it was Libya and the President

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:44.240
- said the evidence of Libya's culpability was irrefutable.
- Yeah.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.560
But the Italian authorities to whom I've spoken say emphatically

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.080
on the record that their investigations have shown

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.080
that it was entirely masterminded by Syria.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.760
I don't agree with that at all.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.240
Well, they interrogated the surviving terrorists.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.880
I must just say I don't agree with that.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.400
But you've no evidence that Libya was in on the planning either.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:09.680
Our evidence on Libya is circumstantial, but very strong.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.400
But why does the President then say it's "irrefutable",

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.240
if you call it "circumstantial"?

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.000
Well, people can be convicted and sentenced in our courts

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.920
on circumstantial evidence.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.480
But what made it even more confusing

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.600
was that although there seemed to be no evidence

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.840
that Gaddafi had been behind the attacks,

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.280
he made no attempt to deny the allegations.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.480
Instead, he went the other way

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.240
and turned the crisis into a global drama...

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.400
It is not a time of saying.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.000
It is a time of war,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.320
a time of confrontation.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.360
..threatening suicide attacks against America.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.720
TRANSLATION:

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.960
Gaddafi now started to play a role

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.480
that was going to become very familiar.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.680
He grabbed the publicity that had been given to him

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.320
by the Americans and used it dramatically.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.880
He promoted himself as an international revolutionary

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.720
who would help to liberate oppressed peoples around the world,

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.600
even the blacks in America.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.760
Gaddafi arranged for a live satellite link

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.640
to a mass meeting of the Nation Of Islam in Chicago.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.280
Brothers and sisters,

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.520
it is with great honour and privilege that I present to you

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.480
the leader of the al-Fateh Revolution from Libya,

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.040
our brother Muammar al-Gaddafi.

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.920
APPLAUSE

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.200
Gaddafi told them that Libya was now their ally

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.040
in their struggle against white America.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:05.320
..To express my full support and support of my country

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.400
to your struggle for freedom, for emancipation.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.960
Gaddafi promised that he would supply weapons

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.560
to create a black army in America of 400,000 men.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.440
"If white America refuses to accept blacks as US citizens,"

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.040
he told them, "it must therefore be destroyed."

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.400
Gaddafi also invited a group of German rocket scientists

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.160
to come to Libya to build him a rocket.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.280
He insisted that it had no military purpose.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.120
Libya was now going to explore outer space.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.400
I think it is peaceful and civil...

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.720
Civilian?

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.160
..civilian activity

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.320
for investigation of space

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.720
and something like this

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.640
and it has nothing to do with any military things.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.560
But no-one believed him.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.280
Journalists warned that Gaddafi was really preparing to attack Europe,

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.160
vividly dramatising the new danger.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.720
That is something like this

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.960
which goes that way to put something into space.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.840
But the same device tilted, say, to an angle of 45 degrees

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.800
could, of course, become something very different -

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.240
a missile possibly carrying a warhead.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.120
That would put Libya within range of an enormous area.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.920
A chilling proposition with its range of 2,000km.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.200
The Americans and Gaddafi now became locked together

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.480
in a cycle of mutual reinforcement.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.280
In the process, a powerful new image was created

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.880
that was going to capture the imagination of the West.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.200
Gaddafi became a global supervillain,

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.360
at the head of what was called a "rogue state" -

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.640
a madman who threatened the stability of the world.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.920
And Gaddafi was loving every minute of it.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.760
So, you think, in the past,

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.440
his decisions sometimes have been taken too quickly...

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.560
- Maybe, maybe.
- ..on world affairs?
- Maybe.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.800
I think, sometimes, that is what has made people in the world

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.720
- nervous of you, perhaps?
- Maybe.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.720
HE CHUCKLES

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.480
Then, there was another terrorist attack

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.600
at a discotheque in West Berlin.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.920
A bomb killed an American soldier and injured hundreds.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.040
The Americans released what they said were intercepts

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040
by the National Security Agency

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.800
that proved that Colonel Gaddafi was behind the bombing

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.280
and a dossier that they said proved that he was also the mastermind

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.560
behind a whole range of other attacks.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.920
President Reagan ordered the Pentagon

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.280
to prepare to bomb Libya.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.960
But again, there were doubts -

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.120
this time, within the American Government itself.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.800
There were concerns that analysts were being pressured

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.520
to make a case that didn't really exist...

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.560
..and to do it, they were taking Gaddafi's rhetoric about himself

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.040
as a global revolutionary and his manic ravings

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.400
and then re-presenting them as fact.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.360
And, in the process, together,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.520
the Americans and Gaddafi were constructing a fictional world.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.480
The analysts were certainly, I'm convinced...

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.160
pressured into developing a prima facie case

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.320
against the Libyan Government.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.240
From the somewhat incoherent ravings of a maniac,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.120
both interceptions of a clandestine nature

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.960
and interceptions of an open radio broadcast or whatever,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.360
as well as other sources, quotations of his,

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.760
one can assemble a neatly-put-together package

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.600
demonstrating that the man had violent interests

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.000
against the United States and its European allies.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.320
The European intelligence agencies

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.560
told the Americans that they were wrong,

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.400
that it was Syria that was behind the bombing, not Libya.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.040
But the Americans had decided to attack Libya

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.000
because they couldn't face the dangerous consequences

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.440
of attacking Syria.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.200
Instead, they went for Gaddafi,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.080
a man without friends or allies.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.040
Libya had less downsided consequences, if you will.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.520
There's less Arab support for Gaddafi,

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.880
we figured there would be less Soviet support for Gaddafi.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:10.440
There's no question that Libya was more vulnerable than Syria and Iran.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.760
- He was a soft target?
- And that is certainly an element, of course.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.120
In April 1986, the Americans attacked Libya.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.920
Their targets included Colonel Gaddafi's own house.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.440
Immediately after the attack,

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.320
Gaddafi appeared in the ruins to describe what had happened.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.280
- TRANSLATION:
- The family were asleep and my wife

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.720
was, that day, tied down to the bed

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.000
because she had a slipped disc.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.720
I tried to rescue the children

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.720
and the house started to collapse,

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.160
as you can see.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.680
And the bombs started to land.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.120
They concentrated on the children's room

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.560
so that they would kill all the children.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.120
Our small adopted daughter was killed

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.840
and two of our children were injured.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.600
But, yet again, Gaddafi might have been lying.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.760
Ever since then,

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.440
there have been rumours that his adopted daughter actually survived.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.040
But many other children were killed in the raid

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.840
because the American bombing was so inaccurate.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.320
Gaddafi realised that the attention of the whole world

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.200
was now focused on him

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.760
and he grabbed the moment to promote his own revolutionary theory,

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.840
The Third Way, as a global alternative to democracy.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.840
- TRANSLATION:
- I feel that I'm really responsible

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.000
for conveying the Third Way theory and the Green Book

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.320
to the rising generations, to the young American and British people,

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.840
so that we can rescue America and Britain

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.760
and these generations of young people from this theory,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.920
this electoral party theory

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.760
which enabled an imbecile like Reagan

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.160
to rule the mightiest power on Earth

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.240
and use it to destroy other people's homes

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.560
and enabled a harlot like Thatcher to rule a great nation like Britain.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.120
- MAN:
- Wow, look at that. What the heck is that?

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.680
Oh, my God, look at that.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.680
Holy crap!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.720
It's just moving really slowly. Wow!

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.240
- Look, look, look! Come here, come here!
- What is it doing?

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.560
What the heck?!

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.440
Guys, it's...

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.120
- Whoa!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.040
Wow!

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.640
- What is happening?
- Dude, what is happening?!

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.760
- What is going on?
- Oh, my gosh!

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.600
- Oh, my God, guys!
- Guys, is that a freaking UFO?

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.040
- Wait, can you get a good video?
- What is it?
- What the hell?

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.360
In the 1980s, more and more people in the United States

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.800
reported seeing unexplained objects and lights in the sky.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.880
At the same time, investigators who believed in UFOs

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.720
revealed that they had discovered top-secret government documents

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.280
that stated that alien craft had visited Earth.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.720
The documents had been hidden for 20 years

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.240
and they seemed to prove that there had been a giant cover-up.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.360
But, actually, the reality was even stranger.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.880
The American Government might have been making it all up,

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.680
that they had created a fake conspiracy

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.480
to deliberately mislead the population.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.560
The lights that people imagined were UFOs

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.600
may, in reality, have been new high-technology weapons

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.200
that the US Government were testing.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.240
The government had developed the weapons

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.720
because they, in turn,

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.600
imagined that the Soviet Union was far stronger than it was

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.000
and still wanted to conquer the world.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.920
The government wanted to keep the weapons secret,

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.760
but they couldn't always hide their appearance in the skies

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.440
so it is alleged that they chose a number of people to use

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.000
to spread the rumour that these were really alien visitations.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.440
One of those chosen was called Paul Bennewitz

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.200
who lived outside a giant air base in New Mexico

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.880
and had noticed strange things going on.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.600
Years later,

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.160
I sat down with Paul at dinner

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.840
and told Paul exactly that everything we did

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.440
was a sanctioned counterintelligence operation to convince him

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.840
that what he was seeing was UFOs

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.240
and that what we didn't want him to know was

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.960
that he had tapped into something on the base

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.520
and we didn't want him to ever disclose that.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.440
We kind of planted the seed in Paul

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.640
that what he was seeing and what he was hearing

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.200
and what he was collecting was, in fact,

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.800
probably, maybe, UFOs.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.880
Bennewitz and others chosen by the agency

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.560
were, it is alleged, given a series of forged documents.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.640
Many of them were top-secret memos by the military

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.400
describing sightings of unidentified aerial vehicles.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.080
The documents spread like wildfire

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.280
and they formed the basis for the wave of belief in UFOs

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.880
that would spread through America in the 1990s.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.800
- What the fuck is that?
- That's a...

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.160
That's crazy, bro.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.080
Is that that space, uh...?

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.200
And it also fuelled the wider growing belief

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.600
that governments lied to you -

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.720
that conspiracies were real.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.080
What the Reagan administration were doing,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.240
both with Colonel Gaddafi and with the UFOs,

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.120
was a blurring of fact and fiction

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.760
but it was part of an even broader programme.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.440
The President's advisers had given it a name -

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.200
they called it "perception management"

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.000
and it became a central part of the American Government

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.520
during the 1980s.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.680
The aim was to tell dramatic stories that grabbed the public imagination,

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.520
not just about the Middle East,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.680
but about Central America

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.360
and the Soviet Union

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.240
and it didn't matter if the stories were true or not,

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.400
providing they distracted people and you, the politician,

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.320
from having to deal with

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.040
the intractable complexities of the real world.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.200
Reality became less and less

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.600
of an important factor in American politics.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.240
It wasn't what was real that was driving anything

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.320
or the facts driving anything.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.760
It was how you could turn those facts or twist those facts

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.640
or even make up the facts to make your opponent look bad.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.240
So, perception management became a device

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.920
and the facts could be twisted. Anything could be anything.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.000
It becomes how can you manipulate the American people?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.640
And, in the process, reality becomes what?

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.320
Reality becomes simply something to play with to achieve that end.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.280
Reality is not important in this context.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.880
Reality is simply something that you handle.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.720
But something was about to happen that would demonstrate dramatically

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.840
just how far the American Government had detached from reality.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.120
The Soviet Empire was about to implode.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.360
And no-one, none of the politicians,

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.840
or the journalists,

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.640
or the think tank experts,

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.960
or the economists,

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.280
or the academics saw it coming.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.040
That's it! Whoo!

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.280
Get ready to work out.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.560
GUNSHOTS

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.640
The collapse of the Soviet Union

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.200
also had a powerful effect on the West.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.400
For many, it symbolised the final failure of the dream

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.720
that politics could be used to build a new kind of world.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.720
What was going to emerge instead was a new system that had nothing

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.360
to do with politics.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.800
A system whose aim was not to try and change things,

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.360
but rather, to manage a post-political world.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.080
One of the first people to describe this dramatic change

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.680
was a left-wing German political thinker called Ulrich Beck.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.120
Beck said that any politician who believed that they could take

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.160
control of society, and drive it forward to build

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.920
a better future, was now seen as dangerous.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.800
In the past, politicians might have been able to do this.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.280
But now they were faced with what he called "a runaway world."

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.280
Where things were so complex and interconnected,

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.200
and modern technologies so potentially dangerous

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.760
that it was impossible to predict the outcomes of anything you did.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.000
The catalogue of environmental disasters proved this.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.120
Politicians would have to give up any idea of trying to change

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.920
the world.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.320
Instead, their new aim would be to try and predict the dangers

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.080
in the future, and then, find ways to avoid those risks.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.920
Although Beck came from the political left,

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.720
the world he saw coming was deeply conservative.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.880
The picture he gave

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.280
was of a political class reduced to trying to steer society

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.000
into a dark and frightening future.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.800
Constantly peering forward

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.720
and trying to see the risks coming towards them.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.560
Their only aim, to avoid those risks

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.960
and keep society stable.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.720
It only lasted for a few seconds so you were basically shocked,

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.840
you really didn't know what was going on at the time.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.280
Where were you in the building and where was the explosion?

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.800
- EXPLOSION
- Oh, my God!

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.880
But a system that could anticipate the future

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.520
and keep society stable was already being built,

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.640
pieced together from all kinds of different,

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.200
and sometimes surprising, sources.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.040
All of them outside politics.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.600
One part of it was taking shape in a tiny town

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.640
in the far north-west of the United States called East Wenatchee.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.720
It was a giant computer

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.760
whose job was to make the future predictable.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.760
The man building it was a banker called Larry Fink.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.200
Back in 1986,

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.000
Mr Fink's career had collapsed.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.240
Shoot!

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.600
He lost 100 million in a deal and had been sacked.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.320
He became determined it wouldn't happen again.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.360
Fink started a company called BlackRock and built

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.720
a computer he called Aladdin.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.080
It is housed in a series of large sheds

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.960
in the apple orchards outside Wenatchee.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.880
Fink's aim was to use the computer to predict, with certainty,

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.960
what the risk of any deal or investment was going to be.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.880
The computer constantly monitors the world

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.360
and it take things that it sees happening,

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.000
and then, compares them to events in the past.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.800
It can do this because it has, in its memory, a vast history

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.640
of the past 50 years. Not just financial, but all kinds of events.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.640
Out of the millions and millions of correlations,

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.520
the computer then spots possible disasters,

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.200
possible dangers lying in the future

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.160
and moves the investments to avoid any radical change

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.640
and keep the system stable.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.240
Today, I'm going to deliver 1.8 million reports.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.240
Execute 25,000 trades.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.800
And avert 3,000 disasters.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.440
I'm going to monitor interest rates in Europe.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.080
- Silver prices in Asia.
- Droughts in the Midwest.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.680
I'm going to witness 4 billion shares change hands on the

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.000
New York Stock Exchange.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.120
And record the effects on 14 trillion in assets

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.600
across 20,000 portfolios.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.960
- I am Aladdin.
- I am Aladdin.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.440
And, today, I'll find the numbers behind the numbers.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.640
I will see the trends the models don't.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.320
- The connections.
- The risks.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.360
- I am Aladdin.
- I am Aladdin, and I will get the data right.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.240
I am 25 million lines of code.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.280
Written by hundreds of people.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.920
Across two decades.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.760
I'm smarter than any algorithm.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.760
More powerful than any processor.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.000
Because I am Aladdin.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.240
Because I am Aladdin.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.720
I am Aladdin.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.240
I am Aladdin...

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.160
Aladdin has proved to be incredibly successful.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.560
The assets it guides and controls

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.600
now amount to 15 trillion,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.080
which is 7% of the world's total wealth.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.840
But Wenatchee was also a dramatic example

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.640
of another kind of craving

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.840
for stability and reassurance.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840
More of its citizens took Prozac

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.520
than practically any other town in America.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.880
When a person's central nervous system is changed by an SSRI,

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.920
with that medicine they will view things differently

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.480
and they will be strangers.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.200
They look at things differently.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.320
I have a chemical up here that changes me.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.480
I think differently.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.320
For me it was like walking around like this for my whole life

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.160
and really not knowing that I was near-sighted. I mean, really.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.120
I mean, no-one had ever offered me glasses.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.640
And then, all of a sudden, here comes somebody that says,

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.160
"OK, now try these on. Try this Prozac on."

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.200
And I tried it on and for the first time in my life I went,

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.840
"Whoa! Is this the way reality really is?"

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.160
Your perception can be changed and it's frightening

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.000
and it's scary to people.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.960
It speaks of science fiction almost.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.760
Well, the medicine just kind of lets you listen to what needs to go on.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.160
And then your doctor, every time you come back, says,

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.440
"You're looking so much better."

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.960
And then every time I go in he goes,

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.520
"You're so beautiful." You know?

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.640
He isn't even sucking up. He's being nice, you know?

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.200
"You're beautiful, you're nice, you're friendly.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.080
"You've got so much going for you." I think, "Yeah, I do."

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.960
So, I go out and tell my friends,

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.240
"I feel so much better about myself."

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.360
Mom goes out, "Oh, I feel so much better about myself."

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.440
So, your friends start saying, "I've seen such an improvement.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.320
"I've seen such improvement."

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.280
And everybody improves all the way around. They see improvement.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.160
It's like everybody's brainwashing each other into being happy.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.360
But there was a more effective way of reassuring people

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.160
that was being developed that did not involve medication.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.160
It, too, came from computer systems

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.880
but this time, artificial intelligence.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.080
But the way to do it had been discovered by accident.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.160
Back in the 1960s, there had been optimistic dreams

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.800
that it would be possible to develop computers

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.840
that could think like human beings.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.600
Scientists then spent years trying to programme the rules

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.360
that governed human thought...

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.120
..but they never worked.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.120
One computer scientist, at MIT,

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.080
became so disillusioned that he decided to build a computer programme

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.080
that would parody these hopeless attempts.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.560
He was called Joseph Weizenbaum

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.240
and he built what he claimed was a computer psychotherapist.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.800
Just like a therapist, people could come and talk to the machine

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.440
by typing in their problems.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.640
Weizenbaum called the programme "Eliza".

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.880
He modelled it on a real psychotherapist called Carl Rogers

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.880
who was famous for simply repeating back to the patient

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.240
what they had just said.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.360
And that is what Eliza did.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.720
The patient sat in front of the screen and typed in

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.560
what they were feeling

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.920
and the programme repeated it back to them,

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.720
often in the form of a question.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.000
He says I'm depressed much of the time.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.560
Well, I need some help.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.480
That much seems certain.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.400
One of the first people to use Eliza was Weizenbaum's secretary

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.080
and her reaction was something that he had not predicted at all.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.000
I asked her to my office and sat her down at the keyboard

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.920
and then she began to type and, of course,

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.200
I looked over her shoulder to make sure everything

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.160
was operating properly. After two or three interchanges

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.760
with the machine she turned to me and she said,

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.240
"Would you mind leaving the room, please?"

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.200
And yet she knew, as Weizenbaum did, that Eliza didn't understand

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.760
a single word that was being typed into it.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.880
You're like my father in some ways.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.440
- You don't argue with me.
- Why do you think I don't argue with you?

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:05.200
- You're afraid of me.
- Does it please you to think I'm afraid of you?

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.120
My father's afraid of everybody.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.560
My father's afraid of everybody...

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.200
Weizenbaum was astonished.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.960
He discovered that everyone who tried Eliza became engrossed.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.240
They would sit for hours telling the machine

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.720
about their inner feelings

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.400
and incredibly intimate details of their lives.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.000
They also liked it because it was free

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.240
of any kind of patronising elitism.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.240
One person said, "After all, the computer doesn't burn out,

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.640
"look down on you, or try to have sex with you."

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.760
What Eliza showed was that, in an age of individualism,

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.640
what made people feel secure

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.720
was having themselves reflected back to them.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.560
Just like in a mirror.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.360
Artificial intelligence changed direction

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.720
and started to create new systems that did just that,

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.080
but on a giant scale.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.080
They were called intelligent agents.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.440
They worked by monitoring individuals,

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.280
gathering vast amounts of data about their past behaviour

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.120
and then looked for patterns and correlations

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.880
from which they could predict what they would want in the future.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.800
It was a system that ordered the world in a way

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.200
that was centred around you.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.200
And in an age of anxious individualism,

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.480
frightened of the future,

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.840
that was reassuring, just like Eliza.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.760
A safe bubble that protected you

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.920
from the complexities of the world outside.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.840
And the applications of this new direction

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.920
proved fruitful and profitable.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.080
If you liked that, you'll love this.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.280
What was rising up in different ways

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.520
was a new system that promised to keep the world stable.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.960
Its tentacles reached into every area of our lives.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.320
Finance promised that it could control the unpredictability

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.840
of the free market...

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.360
..while individuals were more and more monitored

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.320
to stabilise their physical and mental states.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.240
And, increasingly, the intelligent agents online

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.520
predicted what people would want in the future

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.400
and how they would behave.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.160
But the biggest change was to politics.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.160
In a world where the overriding aim was now stability,

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.520
politics became just part of a wider system of managing the world.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.040
The old idea of democratic politics,

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.320
that it gave a voice to the weak against the powerful, was eroded.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.520
And a resentment began to quietly grow out on the edges of society.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.240
But the new system did have a dangerous flaw.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.680
Because in the real world, not everything can be predicted

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680
by reading data from the past.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.480
And someone who was about to discover that,

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.480
to his own cost, was Donald Trump.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.480
One day a man called Jess Marcum received a phone call.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.920
It was from Donald Trump

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.000
and Trump was desperate for help.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.400
Marcum was a strange, mysterious figure.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.640
He had been a nuclear scientist in the 1950s

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.320
and studied the effect of radiation from nuclear weapons

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.000
on the human body.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.760
Then Marcum had gone to Las Vegas and become obsessed by gambling.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.040
He had a photographic memory and he used it to instantly

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.680
process the data of the games as they were played.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.800
From that, he could predict the outcome.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.240
And he always won.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.280
The Las Vegas gangsters were fascinated by him.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.640
They called him "The Automat".

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.040
Where are we going? Let's go. Go, go, go.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.360
Donald Trump was one of the heroes of the age.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.520
But, in reality, much of this success was a facade.

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.880
The banks that had lent Trump millions

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.000
had discovered that he could no longer

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.400
pay the interest on the loans.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.240
Trump's empire was facing bankruptcy.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.240
His wife Ivana hated him because he was having an affair

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.520
with Miss Hawaiian Tropic 1985.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.280
And then, a famous Japanese gambler called Akio Kashiwagi

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.480
came to one of Trump's casinos

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.600
and started to win millions of dollars

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.480
in an extraordinary run of luck.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.280
Trump, who was desperate for money,

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.480
panicked as day-after-day he watched millions

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.600
being siphoned out of his casino.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.560
So, he turned for help to Jess Marcum.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.320
Marcum came to Trump's casino in Atlantic City.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.280
He analysed all the data about the way the Kashiwagi had been playing.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.920
He then told Trump to suggest a particular high-stakes game

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.320
that he knew the Japanese gambler could not resist.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:17.440
His model, Marcum said, predicted that Kashiwagi had to lose.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.160
And after five agonising days, he did.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.480
Kashiwagi lost 10 million and he gave up.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.880
Donald Trump was elated.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.880
He thought he'd got his money back.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.360
IN JAPANESE:

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.360
Before Kashiwagi could pay his debt,

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.640
he was hacked to death in his kitchen by Yakuza gangsters...

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.360
..and Donald Trump didn't get his money.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.680
Trump's business went bankrupt

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.040
and he was forced to sell most of his buildings to the banks.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.600
And he married Miss Hawaiian Tropic.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.120
In the future, he would sell his name to other people

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.480
to put on their buildings

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:22.120
and he himself would become a celebrity tycoon.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.440
President Assad didn't want stability.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.080
He wanted revenge.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.960
In December 1988,

01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:52.400
a bomb exploded on a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie in Scotland.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.600
Almost immediately, investigators and journalists

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.240
pointed the finger at Syria.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.000
"The bombing had been done," they said, "in revenge for the Americans

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.920
"shooting down an Iranian airliner in the Gulf a few months before."

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.560
And for 18 months, everyone agreed that this was the truth.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.640
But then, a strange thing happened.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.640
The security agencies said that they had been wrong.

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.240
It hadn't been Syria at all.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.360
It was Libya who had been behind the Lockerbie bombing.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.960
But many journalists and politicians did not believe it.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.160
They were convinced that the switch had happened

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.040
for the most cynical of reasons.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.720
That America and Britain desperately needed Assad as an ally

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.520
in the coming Gulf War against Saddam Hussein.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:49.640
So, once again, they blamed Colonel Gaddafi as the terrorist mastermind.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.520
Syria, of course, was, unfortunately, accused

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.120
of many terrorist outrages and of harbouring terrorist groups.

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.480
It appears that we have now restored relations with them,

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.080
as have the Americans. They're now our friends,

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.240
although we've got no real assurances on the past whatsoever.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.840
It strikes me as very strange indeed that many of the things

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.840
we thought were previously the responsibility of Syria

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:15.560
have now, dramatically, become the responsibility of Libya.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.680
But Assad was not really in control.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.320
Because he had released forces

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.520
that no-one would be able to control.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.400
The force that, ten years before,

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.120
he had brought from Iran to attack the West - the human bomb -

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.720
was now about to jump, like a virus,

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.760
from Shia to Sunni Islam.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.600
In December 1992, the militant group Hamas

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.040
kidnapped an Israeli border guard and stabbed him to death.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.360
The Israeli response was overwhelming.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.280
They arrested 415 members of Hamas,

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.960
put them on buses and took them to the top of a bleak mountain

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.000
in southern Lebanon.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.680
They left them there -

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.640
and refused to allow any humanitarian aid through.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.000
THEY CHANT AND SHOUT

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.440
But the Israelis had dumped the Hamas militants

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.520
in an area controlled by Hezbollah.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.640
They spent six months there,

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.280
and during that time, they learnt from Hezbollah

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:34.760
how powerful suicide bombing could be.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.280
Hezbollah told them how they had used it

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.920
to force the Israelis out of Beirut

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.680
and back to the border.

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.720
The first sign that the idea had spread to Hamas

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.760
was when a group of the deportees

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.240
marched in protest towards the Israeli border,

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.280
dressed as martyrs, as the Israelis shelled them.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.720
But it soon became more than just theatre.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.080
Hamas began a wave of suicide attacks in Israel.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:09.080
- REPORTER:
- Just before nine, at the height of Tel Aviv's rush hour,

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.560
the bomb ripped apart a commuter bus.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.360
An amateur cameraman recorded the scene in the moments afterwards

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.800
as a dazed woman was helped out of the smouldering wreckage.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.520
I didn't want to believe that under my house there is a bomb.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.280
And when I realised it's a bomb, I...

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.920
I started to cry.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.560
Because it was the first time I saw it in Tel Aviv.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:37.800
Hamas sent the bombers into the heart of Israeli cities

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.680
to blow themselves up and kill as many around them as possible.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.600
In doing this, Hamas were going much further than Hezbollah ever had.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.800
They were targeting civilians,

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.920
something Hezbollah had never done.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.200
The tactic shocked the Sunni world.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.800
This was something completely alien to its history.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.600
Not only did the Koran forbid suicide,

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.960
but Sunni Islam did not have any rituals of self-sacrifice -

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.360
unlike the Shias.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.520
The most senior religious leader in Saudi Arabia

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.840
insisted it was wrong.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.560
But a mainstream theologian from Egypt

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.400
called Sheikh Qaradawi seized the moment.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.000
He issued a fatwa that justified the attacks.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.960
"And," he added, "it was also justified to kill civilians,

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.240
"because, in Israel, everyone -

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.160
"including women - serve as reservists.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.880
"So, really, they are all part of the enemy army."

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.240
- TRANSLATION:
- It's not suicide. It is martyrdom in the name of God.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.960
Islamic theologians and jurisprudence

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.680
have debated this issue.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.520
Israeli women are not like women in our society,

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.560
because Israeli women are militarised.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.600
Secondly, I consider this type of martyrdom operation

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.320
as an indication of justice of Allah, our Almighty.

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.920
Allah is just.

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.560
Through his infinite wisdom,

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.320
he has given the weak what the strong do not possess.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.800
And that is their ability to turn their bodies into bombs

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.000
like the Palestinians do.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.720
Hamas kept sending the bombers into Israel.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.480
Sometimes day-after-day.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.880
The horror overwhelmed Israeli society

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.360
and it completely destroyed the ability of politics

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.280
to solve the Palestinian crisis.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.440
Instead, in the Israeli election of 1996,

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:39.040
Benjamin Netanyahu took power.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.320
He turned against the peace process, which was exactly what Hamas wanted.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.120
And from then on, the two sides became locked together

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.520
in ever more horrific cycles of violence.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.520
# Netanyahu! #

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.080
The human bomb had destroyed the very thing

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.440
that President Assad had first wanted.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:02.320
A real political solution to the Palestinian question.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.960
- REPORTER:
- It was just after one o'clock

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.000
and the market was full of shoppers.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.360
SIRENS WAIL

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.120
Streams of ambulances came to carry away the dead and the injured.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.240
It was a place of appalling suffering.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.720
But even with the first grief

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.840
came the immediate political impact on the peace process.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.960
Peace impossible!

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.560
This moment, it will be the end!

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.680
It must be the end of this bloody peace process.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.560
And, in America, all optimistic visions of the future

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.000
had also disappeared.

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.400
Instead everyone in society - not just the politicians -

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.200
but the scientists, the journalists, and all kinds of experts

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.360
had begun to focus on the dangers that might be hidden in the future.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.640
This, in turn, created a pessimistic mood

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.960
that then began to spread out from the rational technocratic world

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.040
and infect the whole of the culture.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.920
And everyone became possessed by dark forebodings,

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.480
imagining the very worst that might happen.

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.640
# Dream, baby, dream

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.520
# Dream, baby, dream

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.800
# Dream, baby, dream

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.680
# Dream, baby, dream

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.160
# Forever

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.720
# Oh, dream, baby, dream

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.800
# Dream, baby, dream

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.920
# Dream, baby, dream

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.080
# Dream, baby, dream

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.360
# Forever... #

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.800
# ..Dream, baby, dream

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.240
# Oh, baby, we gotta keep that dream alive

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.680
# Keep that dream alive

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.040
# Forever

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.000

# Oh, dream, baby, dream... # SCREAMING

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.080
PANICKED SCREAMS

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.680
RUMBLING, SHATTERING GLASS

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.520
# Oh, you keep that fire, burning, baby

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.040
# Oh, you gotta keep that flame burning brightly, baby... #

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.360
CRASHING EXPLOSIONS

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.400
SILENCE

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.520
DISTANT SIRENS

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.600
The attacks in September 2001 were suicide bombs,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.040
but now on a huge scale.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.400
They demonstrated the terrifying power of this new force

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.040
to penetrate all defences.

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.760
They had come to kill thousands of Americans on their own soil.

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.520
20 years before,

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.480
President Reagan had been confronted by the first suicide bombers.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.800
They had been unleashed by President Assad of Syria

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.080
to force America out of the Middle East.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:40.480
But rather than confront the complexity of Syria

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.240
and Israel and the Palestinian problem,

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.480
America had retreated and left Syria -

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.320
and suicide bombing -

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.160
to fester and mutate.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.680
They had gone instead for Colonel Gaddafi

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.280
and turned him into an evil global terrorist.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:02.640
But, in the process, this changed the way people saw

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.360
and understood terrorism.

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.760
Instead of a violence born out of political struggles for power,

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.240
it became replaced by a much simpler image of an evil tyrant

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.240
at the head of a rogue state

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.400
who became more like an archcriminal

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.400
who wanted to terrorise the world.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.600
All the politics and power dropped away.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.840
The problem was just them and their evil personalities.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:43.120
And after 9/11, this led to a new, and equally simple, idea.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.600
That if only you could remove these tyrannical figures,

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.920
then the grateful people of their country

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.360
would transform naturally into a democracy,

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.000
because they would be free of the evil.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.120
We owe it to the future of civilisation

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.080
not to allow the world's worst leaders

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.080
to develop and deploy, and therefore,

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.320
blackmail freedom-loving countries

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.280
with the world's worst weapons.

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.960
We know they've already got chemical and biological weapons there.

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.160
We know that they're certainly doing their best

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.960
to acquire nuclear weapons technology.

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.640
If we allow them to do that,

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.600
and do nothing about it, then,

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.200
I think, later generations will consider us deeply irresponsible.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.120
Both Tony Blair and George Bush became possessed by the idea

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.000
of ridding the world of Saddam Hussein.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.360
So possessed that they believed any story

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.080
that proved his evil intentions.

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.920
And the line between reality and fiction became ever more blurred.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.520
In September 2002, the head of MI6 rushed to Downing Street

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.400
to tell Blair excitedly that they had finally found the source

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.000
that confirmed everything.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.440
The source, he said, had "direct access"

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.440
to Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons programme

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.640
which was making vast quantities of VX and sarin nerve agents.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.000
The nerve agents were being loaded into "linked hollow glass spheres".

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.760
But then someone in MI6 noticed

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.680
that the detail the source was describing was identical

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.880
to scenes in the 1996 movie The Rock,

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.400
starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.640
Really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.400
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.320
What exactly does this stuff do?

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.680
If the rocket renders it aerosol,

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.720
it could take out the entire city of people.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.720
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.160
Stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord...

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:48.280
A later report into the Iraq War pointed out,

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.160
"Glass containers were not typically used in chemical munitions..."

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.880
..seizes your nervous system... Do not move that!

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.720
"..and the informant had obviously seen

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.560
"a popular movie known as The Rock

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:02.600
"that had inaccurately depicted nerve agents being carried

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.200
"in glass beads or spheres."

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.240
..that's after your skin melts off.

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.680
My God.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.280
That there is a threat from Saddam Hussein

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.800
and the weapons of mass destruction that he has acquired,

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.440
is not in doubt at all.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.880
Hafez al-Assad had died in 2000.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.040
His son, Bashar, became the new president of Syria.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.040
But he couldn't escape the inexorable logic

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.840
of what his father had started.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.480
20 years before, his father had sent Shi'ite suicide bombers

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.560
to attack the Americans in Lebanon.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.040
Now, as America and Britain invaded Iraq,

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.960
Bashar decided that he would copy his father.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.920
But what he was about to let loose would tear the Arab world apart -

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.360
and then come back to try to destroy him.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.560
STATELY FANFARE PLAYS

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.840
Bashar Assad had was never supposed to have been president.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.360
It was always going to have been his elder brother, Bassel.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.560
But then, Bassel had died in a car crash.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.240
So now, Bashar took over the giant palace

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.720
that his father had built above Damascus.

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:42.280
Up to this point, Bashar had not been interested in politics.

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.960
He was fascinated by computers.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.080
He founded the Syrian Computer Society

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.800
and brought the internet to the country.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.640
His favourite band was the Electric Light Orchestra.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.880
But now, he was president.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.680
And he set out to attack America.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.280
Bashar Assad was convinced that the invasion of Iraq

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.000
was just the first step of a plot by the Western powers

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.200
to take over the whole of the Middle East.

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.360
He knew that the invasion had outraged

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.080
many of the radical Islamists in Syria

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.000
and what they most wanted to do was to go to Iraq and kill Americans.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.080
So, Bashar instructed the Syrian Intelligence Services

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.120
to help them do this.

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.880
Syrian agents set up a pipeline

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.440
that began to feed thousands of militants across the border

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.680
and into the heart of the insurgency.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.680
And it grew.

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:48.320
Within a year, almost all of the foreign fighters

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.120
from across the world were coming through Syria...

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.280
..and they brought suicide bombing with them.

01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:00.720
The Americans estimated that 90% of the suicide bombers in Iraq

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.400
were foreign fighters.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.640
But it began to run out of control.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.080
Most of the jihadists had joined the group al-Qaeda in Iraq

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.120
that then turned to killing Shi'ites in an attempt to create a civil war.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.040
And the force that had originally been invented by the Shi'ites,

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.360
suicide bombing, now returned

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.280
and started to kill them.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.240
Then, this.

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:35.480
EXPLOSION

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.000
STUNNED SILENCE

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.640
A moment of silence before people realised what was happening.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.240
SCREAMING

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:45.520
A few seconds ago, we just had repeated explosions

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.080
in the street below me.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:48.680
People are now fleeing in terror

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.800
from the central square around the mosque.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.000
- This is what everybody feared...
- DISTANT EXPLOSION

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.240
We just heard another explosion in the distance.

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.160
..that somebody would try to target this religious festival

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:01.200
to try to bring about a sectarian conflict in Iraq.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.240
SCREAMING

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.400
There was panic.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.400
A terrified stampede.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.200
But some of these people were running into the next bombs.

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.080
EXPLOSIONS

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:22.440
We counted at least six separate explosions.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:27.160
MUSIC DROWNS AUDIO

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:39.680
Tony Blair and George Bush were faced by disaster.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.720
Iraq was imploding.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.120
While, at home, they were being accused of lying to their own people

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.560
to justify the invasion.

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:50.920
What they desperately needed was something that would show

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.360
that the invasion was having a good effect in the Arab world.

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.320
So, they made an extraordinary decision.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.720
They turned for help to the man who they had always insisted

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:06.280
was one of the world's most dangerous tyrants.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.760
Colonel Gaddafi.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.760
And, instead, they set out to make him their new best friend.

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.280
It was going to be the highest achievement

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.520
of Perception Management.

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.240
A man who had been created by the West

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:27.080
as a fake global supervillain

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.680
was now going to be turned into a fake hero of democracy.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.320
And everyone, not just politicians, would become involved.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.520
Public relations, academics,

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.720
television presenters, spies, and even musicians

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.760
were all going to help reinvent Colonel Gaddafi.

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.280
It would show just how many people in the Western Establishment

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:54.520
had, by now, become the engineers of this fake world.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.480
Ever since he had been accused of the Lockerbie bombing,

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.480
Colonel Gaddafi had been a complete outcast.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.800
The West had imposed sanctions on Libya

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.040
and the economy was falling apart.

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:17.680
But then, suddenly, Tony Blair broke live into the BBC evening news.

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.200
The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is about to make a statement,

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.360
the BBC understands, from Downing Street.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.000
It's of international significance.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.120
He'll be making his statement at any moment now.

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.200
We can see pictures of him in Durham...

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.760
- This evening...
- Here he is.

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.320
..Colonel Gaddafi has confirmed that Libya has, in the past,

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.360
sought to develop weapons-of-mass-destruction

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.720
capabilities.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.240
Libya has now declared its intention to dismantle

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.600
its weapons of mass destruction completely.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.000
This decision by Colonel Gaddafi is a historic one,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.040
and a courageous one, and I applaud it.

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.560
Today, in Tripoli,

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:57.000
the leader of Libya,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.440
Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi...

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:05.120
..publically confirmed his commitment to disclose and dismantle

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.320
all weapons-of-mass-destruction programmes in his country.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.640
Colonel Gaddafi now became,

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:15.120
for Western politicians, a heroic figure.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:18.480
His decision to give up his weapons of mass destruction

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.800
seemed to prove that the invasion of Iraq

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.720
could transform the Middle East.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.840
And Tony Blair travelled to meet Gaddafi in his desert tent.

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.120
To welcome him back into what one journalist called,

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.720
"The community of civilised nations."

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.960
But, as in the past,

01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:48.760
nothing was what it seemed with Colonel Gaddafi.

01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:53.440
In reality, Gaddafi did not really have

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.600
the terrifying weapons of mass destruction

01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:58.200
that he was promising to destroy.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.000
His nuclear programme had stuttered to a halt long ago

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.080
and never produced anything dangerous.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:08.240
He had managed to buy some equipment on the black market,

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:11.840
but his technicians had been unable to assemble it.

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.560
His biological weapons were non-existent.

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.800
All he had was some old mustard gas in leaking barrels.

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.040
But now, he had to pretend to have a terrifying arsenal of weapons.

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.160
And the West had to pretend

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.760
that they had avoided another global threat.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.200
And then the made-up stories became even more complicated.

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.440
As part of the deal, the West said that if Gaddafi admitted

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.840
that Libya had done the Lockerbie bombing,

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.400
then they would lift the sanctions.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.160
But many of those who had investigated Lockerbie

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:51.120
were still convinced that Libya hadn't done it.

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.840
That, really, it had been Syria.

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.600
But Colonel Gaddafi confessed.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.360
His son, Saif, was interviewed about this confession.

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.240
He said that his father was simply pretending

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.200
that he had been behind the Lockerbie bombing

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.800
to get the sanctions lifted.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.200
That new lies were being built on top of old lies

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:15.200
to construct a completely make-believe world.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.440
You have to accept, or you had to accept at the time,

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.000
a responsibility, because you have to accept responsibilities,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.520
you have to pay compensation in order to get rid of sanction.

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.240
We did that, not because we are convinced that we did it,

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.760
but because of the final exit out of this nightmare.

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.080
So, what you're saying is that you accept responsibility,

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:41.400
- but you're not admitting that you did it.
- Yes.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.040
And this is all a sham,

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.880
you're saying, just to get sanctions over with

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.000
so that you can start normal diplomatic relations with the West.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.680
OK. OK. What's wrong with that?

01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:00.440
It's a very cynical way to behave, as a country, isn't it?

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:03.600
- Many people would say...
- First of all...

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.160
I mean, the Americans and the British,

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.760
they told us to write that letter.

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.000
They told us to pay compensation.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.080
And then, they opened their embassies

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.000
and they restored their relation.

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.280
They came to us.

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.040
It was their game. Not our game.

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.600
Does the... Does the leader know there's a picture on the television?

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:30.560
- Will you tell him?
- Oh, good. Thank you.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.800
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.560
Public relations companies then came to Libya

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:42.560
to do what they called "reframing the narrative".

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:48.080
One firm was paid 3 million to turn Gaddafi

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.760
into what they described as a modern world thinker.

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:53.440
CREW MURMURS

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:57.000
OK. We're going in ten.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.440
They did this by bringing other famous world thinkers

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.600
and TV presenters out to Libya to meet the colonel

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.640
and discuss his theories.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:11.680
Hello, and welcome to Libya In The Global Age,

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:16.280
A Conversation With Muammar Gaddafi.

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:22.760
But first, let's get the story so far of Libya.

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:26.440
One world thinker was called Lord Anthony Giddens.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:30.440
Coincidentally, he had a theory which he called "The Third Way"

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.800
which had inspired Tony Blair.

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:38.120
Colonel Gaddafi's own theory was called "The Third Universal Theory."

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.400
Lord Giddens later wrote about his talks

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.440
with the Libyan leader.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.000
"Colonel Gaddafi likes my term 'the third way'

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.400
"because his own political philosophy

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.920
"is a version of this idea.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:53.360
"He makes many intelligent and perceptive points.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.640
"I leave enlivened and encouraged."

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:03.120
That for 40 years, the leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi...

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:06.800
And then, Colonel Gaddafi achieved his lifelong dream.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:10.160
He was invited to address the United Nations.

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:14.840
He spent almost two hours explaining his Third International Theory.

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.880
And also demanding an investigation

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.920
into the shootings of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.280
When he was in New York, Gaddafi was offered a tent,

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.480
just like the one he had at home,

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.520
in the gardens of a grand mansion.

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:33.280
The man who made the offer was Donald Trump.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:35.200
- TRUMP:
- 'I've dealt with everybody.

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.480
- 'And by the way, I can tell you something else!'
- What?

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.480
'I've dealt with Gaddafi.'

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:44.280
- What did you do?
- 'Excuse me. I rented him a piece of land.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.680
'He paid me more for one night than the land was worth

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.720
'for the whole year or for two years.

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.360
'And then, I didn't let him use the land!

01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:53.960
- 'That's what we should be doing.'
- Was that over in New Jersey?

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:56.360
'I don't want to use the word "screw", but I screwed him.

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:57.840
'That's what we should be doing!'

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.520
People in Britain and America now began to

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.120
turn away from politics.

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:23.960
The effect of the Iraq war had been very powerful.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.960
Not only did millions of people feel that they had been lied to

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.960
over the weapons of mass destruction,

02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:32.120
but there was a deeper feeling - that whatever

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:33.840
they did or said had no effect.

02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.960
That despite the mass protests, and the fears and the warnings -

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.600
the war had happened anyway.

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:47.200
Liberals, radicals and a whole new generation

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.800
of young people retreated.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.320
They turned instead to another world that was free of this hypocrisy

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:56.840
and the corruption of politics

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.440
They went into cyberspace.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:03.800
# Once upon a time it was you by the door

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.280
# I... #

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.560
By now cyberspace had become even more

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.640
sophisticated and responsive to human interaction.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.880
The online world was full of algorithms

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.680
that could analyse and predict human behaviour.

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:46.880
The man behind much of this was

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.480
a scientist called Judea Pearl.

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:52.760
He was the godfather of modern Artificial Intelligence.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.640
Pearl's breakthrough had been to use what were

02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:58.640
called Bayesian Belief Networks.

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:02.520
They were systems that could predict behaviour,

02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:05.000
even when the information was incomplete.

02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.760
But to make the system work, Pearl and others had imported

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.520
a model of human beings drawn from economics.

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:18.040
They created what were called rational agents,

02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:20.640
software that mimicked human beings

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.360
but in a very simplified form.

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:27.200
The model assumed that the agent would always act rationally in

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.520
order to get what it wanted. Nothing more.

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.520
One of the early utopians of cyberspace,

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.480
Jaron Lanier, warned of the implications of this.

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:41.400
"The agent's model of what you are

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.280
"interested in will always be a cartoon.

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:48.120
"And in return you will see a cartoon

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.880
"version of the world through the agent's eyes."

02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:57.040
And, he added, "It will never be clear

02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.080
"who they are working for - you or someone else."

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.200
New technology began to allow people to upload

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.000
millions of images and videos into cyberspace.

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.600
And the web - which up to that point had seemed

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.440
like an abstract otherworld - began to

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.400
look and feel like the real world.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.440
INDISTINCT

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.760
No, not yet.

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.240
From videos of animals, personal moments of

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:36.400
experience, extraordinary events,

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.720
to horrific terror videos, more and more was uploaded.

02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:40.760
HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.080
And in a strange, sad twist,

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.840
the first terrorist beheading video that was

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.800
posted online was that of

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.720
Judea Pearl's own son, Daniel Pearl.

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.240
He was a journalist for the

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:13.800
Wall Street Journal and had been kidnapped by

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.680
radical Islamists in Pakistan.

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.840
They recorded what they said was his confession...

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.320
..and then his killing.

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:27.880
My name is Daniel Pearl.

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.440
I'm a Jewish-American.

02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.400
I come from... On my father's side of the family, are Zionists.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:36.320
My father is Jewish.

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.960
My mother is Jewish. I'm Jewish.

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:44.120
Only now do I think about some of the people in Guantanamo Bay

02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:46.240
must be in a similar situation.

02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:52.040
This was a new world that the old systems of power

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:55.120
found it very difficult to deal with.

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.920
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks,

02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.040
the security agencies secretly collected data from

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.640
millions of people online.

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.960
One programme was called Optic Nerve. It took stills from

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.240
the webcam conversations of millions of people across the world,

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:13.320
trying to spot terrorists planning another attack.

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:18.040
The programme did not discover a single terrorist.

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.120
But it did discover something else.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:23.520
A top secret assessment said...

02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:57.520
But increasingly, people were using

02:05:57.520 --> 02:06:00.000
the internet in other ways - to present themselves as

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.320
THEY wanted to be seen.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.760
I guess the video blog is about me.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.680
I don't really want to tell you where I live

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.120
because you could, like, stalk me.

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:17.000
The web drew people in because it was mesmerising.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.520
It was somewhere that you could explore

02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.600
and get lost in in any way you wanted.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.080
But behind the screen, like in a two-way mirror,

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:28.240
the simplified agents were watching and

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:31.120
predicting and guiding your hand on the mouse.

02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.280
Stop...

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.960
I nearly... threw my phone away!

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.000
Stop! Stop!

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.320
- Pose.
- Pose. And snap a selfie...

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.520
PHONE CAMERA WHIRS

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.880
- There you go.
- There you go.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.880
They play with themselves.

02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.440
But what they don't know...

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.960
As the intelligent systems online gathered

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:30.440
ever more data, new forms of guidance began to emerge.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:34.560
Social media created filters -

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.480
complex algorithms that looked at what

02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:39.320
individuals liked - and then fed more of the same

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.360
back to them.

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.280
In the process, individuals began to

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:48.360
move, without noticing, into bubbles that

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:51.800
isolated them from enormous amounts of other information.

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:55.400
They only heard and saw what they liked.

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.960
And the news feeds increasingly

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.360
excluded anything that might challenge people's

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.760
pre-existing beliefs.

02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:09.720
# And now it's all right

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:14.720
# I know my own lie

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.640
# Is coming to say

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.680
# You will call out

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:24.760
# Yourself

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:27.520
# I know I thought

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:32.840
# Makes my face and hands cold

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.360
# And I

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.680
# Ooh

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:38.400
# Ooh

02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:41.360
# Ooh... #

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.720
The version of cyberspace that was

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.880
rising up seemed to be very much like

02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:59.960
William Gibson's original vision.

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.920
That behind the superficial freedoms of the web

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:07.920
were a few giant corporations with opaque systems that controlled

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.520
what people saw and shaped what they thought.

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.160
And what was even more mysterious was

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:19.400
how they made their decisions about what you should like.

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.400
And what should be hidden from you.

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.240
But then, the other utopian vision of cyberspace re-emerged.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.400
Taking over the roadway.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.360
CHANTING

02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.080
Take it!

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.840
CHEERING AND WHOOPING

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:50.880
CHANTING

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:53.960
After the financial crash of 2008

02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:55.880
the politicians saved the banks.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.640
But they did practically nothing about the massive corruption

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.680
that was revealed in its wake.

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:03.720
And the reason they gave was that it might

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.160
destabilise the system.

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.000
Public anger burst out. The Occupy movement took over Wall Street

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.640
and then the Senate in Washington.

02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:16.040
The issue is that certain individuals

02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.840
that are very wealthy, have pretty much corrupted our political system

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:21.680
and this is the heart of it.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.360
This is the Senate building.

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.320
These people have been cut off and they've corrupted our democracy

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.880
and it's literally killing people.

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:30.440
I'm an Iraqi war vet. I went to Iraq in 2009.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.120
I've seen what happens first hand when we let corruption

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.280
rule our elected government and democracy. We're coming here today

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.800
just to raise awareness.

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:40.000
What drove the Occupy movement was the

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.200
original dream of the internet that people

02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.760
like John Perry Barlow had outlined in the early 1990s.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.640
In his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.200
Barlow had described a new world free of politics and the

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.560
old hierarchies of power.

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.760
A space where people connected together as equals in a network

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.080
and built a new society without leaders.

02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:07.160
Now, the Occupy movement set out to

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:09.720
build that kind of society in the real world.

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.200
The camps were to be the models.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:18.000
All the meetings used the idea of the human microphone.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.960
People throughout the crowd repeated a

02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:22.560
speaker's words so everyone could hear them.

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.280
- ALL:
- We are now going to vote...

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:29.000
- SPEAKER:
- ..on whether to stay here for the next two hours...

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.760
- ALL:
- ..on whether to stay here for the next two hours...

02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.880
- SPEAKER:
- ..or leave now.

02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.360
- ALL:
- ..or leave now.

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:39.400
But if someone wanted to challenge the speaker,

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.760
the human amplifiers also had to repeat THEIR words

02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:45.320
so their voice had equal power.

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.960
- SPEAKER:
- ..what she said...

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.440
- ALL:
- ..what she said...

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.640
- SPEAKER:
- ..was that...
- ALL:
- ..was that...
- SPEAKER:
- ..the proposal...

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:54.880
Each person was an autonomous individual who expressed

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.080
what they believed.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:00.920
But together they became components in a network that organised itself

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.480
through the feedback of information around the system.

02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:09.160
You could organise people without the exercise of power.

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:10.840
CHANTING

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:11.960
CAR HORNS BLARE

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:14.520
The crisis in Egypt.

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:17.800
CHANTING AND SHOUTING

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:22.080
A march through our main streets.

02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.000
Looks like chaos. Looks like

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.680
police is running around

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:31.000
and a few hundred people walking down the street.

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.720
Then, almost immediately, the Arab Spring began.

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.920
The first revolution started in Tunisia,

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.960
but it quickly spread to Egypt.

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:46.160
On January 25th 2011, thousands of Egyptians

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:48.720
came out in groups across Cairo and then

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:51.000
started moving towards Tahrir Square.

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:56.800
It seemed like a spontaneous uprising but the internet

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.480
had played a key role in organising the groups.

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:02.520
One of the main activists was

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:05.480
an Egyptian computer engineer called Wael Ghonim.

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.160
He worked for Google in Egypt

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:11.080
but he had also set up the Facebook site that

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:14.160
played the key role in organising the first protests.

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:18.240
As hundreds of thousands took over Tahrir Square,

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.720
Ghonim gave an interview on Egyptian TV.

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:06.680
But Ghonim was also overwhelmed by the power

02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:08.520
this new technology had,

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.080
that a computer engineer with a keyboard could call out

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:14.120
thousands of people...

02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:17.000
some of whom then died in the midst of the protests.

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.440
Many liberals in the West saw this as proof

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:56.800
of the revolutionary power of the internet.

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.960
Again it seemed to be able to organise

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.680
a revolution without leaders.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:05.000
A revolution powerful enough to topple a brutal dictator

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.160
who had been backed by America and the West for 30 years.

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:17.520
But the internet radicals were not the

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.880
only ones who saw their dreams being fulfilled

02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:21.000
in the Arab Spring.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.720
Many of the political leaders of the West also

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:27.560
enthusiastically supported the revolutions

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:31.280
because it seemed to fit with their simple idea of regime change.

02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.840
It might have failed in Iraq

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:37.800
but now the people, everywhere, were rising up to rid

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:40.560
themselves of the evil tyrants.

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.360
And democracy would flourish.

02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.480
So when an uprising began in Libya,

02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:00.960
Britain, France and America supported it.

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.760
And suddenly, Colonel Gaddafi stopped being

02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:05.920
a hero of the West.

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.040
All the politicians, and the public relations people, and the academics

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.920
who had all promoted him as a global thinker

02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:17.320
suddenly disappeared.

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:23.320
And Gaddafi became yet again an evil dictator who had to be overthrown.

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:28.400
His son Saif said, "The way these people are

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.040
"disowning me and my father is disgusting.

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.840
"Just a few months ago, we were being treated as

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.760
"honoured friends.

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:40.120
"Now that rebels are threatening our country, these cowards

02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:41.360
"are turning on us."

02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:45.600
Colonel Gaddafi retreated to the ruins of the house that

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:49.840
the Americans had bombed 30 years before and addressed the world.

02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:53.400
- TRANSLATION:
- Muammar Gaddafi is the glory.

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.720
If I had a position, if I were a president,

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.880
I would have resigned.

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.680
I would have thrown my resignation in your face.

02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.360
But I have no position, no post.

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.080
I have nowhere to resign from.

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:08.120
I have my gun, I have my rifle to fight for Libya.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:12.400
Withdraw your children from the streets.

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.080
Take your children back.

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:18.400
They are drugging your children.

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.200
They are making your children drunk

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.120
and they are sending them to hell.

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.400
Your children will die. What for?

02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:41.240
In November 2011 a large convoy was spotted driving at high speed

02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:44.000
away from Colonel Gaddafi's home town of Sirte.

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:46.560
An American drone,

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.160
controlled from a shed outside Las Vegas,

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.400
was sent to follow it.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.080
CAR HORN BEEPS

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:57.240
CAR HORNS BEEP

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:02.400
The operator fired a missile at the lead car of the convoy.

02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:16.480
Gaddafi then fled - looking for shelter from

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:18.080
the oncoming rebel forces.

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:21.600
He hid under the road in a drainage pipe.

02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:59.040
But instead of becoming a democracy,

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.040
Libya began to descend into chaos.

02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:13.160
And the other revolutions were also failing.

02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:16.920
The Occupy camps had become trapped in endless meetings.

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:18.920
And it became clear that there

02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.040
was a terrible confusion at the heart of the movement.

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:23.680
The radicals had believed that if

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:26.520
they could create a new way of organising people

02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:29.120
then a new society would emerge.

02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.960
But what they did not have was a picture of what that

02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:35.040
society would be like, a vision of the future.

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:40.360
The truth was that their revolution was not about an idea.

02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:43.520
It was about how you manage things.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:48.760
And those who had started the revolution

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:52.000
in Egypt came face-to-face with the same terrible fact.

02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:54.480
Social media had helped

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.960
to bring people together in Tahrir square.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.800
But once there, the internet gave no clue as

02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:03.880
to what kind of new society they could create in Egypt.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:06.560
The movement stalled.

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.440
And a group that DID have a powerful idea - the

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:13.320
Muslim Brotherhood - rushed in to fill the vacuum.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:16.920
The Brotherhood took power in an election

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:19.800
and one of them, Mohamed Morsi, became President.

02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:24.880
The liberals and the Left were shocked.

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.760
And, bit by bit, they turned back to

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:30.040
the military, protesting, asking them to save

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:32.920
the revolution from being captured by Islamists.

02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:40.720
In the spring of 2013, the military took action.

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.600
They arrested the President and

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:45.480
killed hundreds of his supporters who protested.

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:50.960
And an extraordinary spectacle unfolded in Tahrir Square.

02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:54.040
Thousands of the liberal activists who

02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:56.360
had begun the revolution two years before,

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:59.440
summoned by social media, now welcomed the

02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.440
military back by waving their laser pens at the

02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:04.240
helicopters flying overhead.

02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.720
The crowd had been summoned there once again by Facebook.

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:44.560
After the failure of the revolutions, it was not

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:47.480
just the radicals - no-one in the West had

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.720
any idea of how to change the world.

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.520
At home, the politicians had given so much of their

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.360
power away, to finance and the ever-growing

02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:59.680
managerial bureaucracies, that they in effect

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.600
had become managers themselves.

02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:06.080
While abroad, all their adventures had failed.

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:10.040
And their simplistic vision of the world had been exposed

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:11.840
as dangerous and destructive.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:18.960
But in Russia, there was a group of men who

02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:21.000
had seen how this very lack of belief in

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.640
politics, and dark uncertainty about the

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.960
future could work to their advantage.

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.880
What they had done was turn politics into a strange

02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.720
theatre where nobody knew what was true or

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:35.160
what was fake any longer.

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:41.280
They were called political technologists and they were

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.440
the key figures behind President Putin.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.800
They had kept him in power, unchallenged, for 15 years.

02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.600
Some of them had been dissidents back in the 1970s

02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:55.480
and had been powerfully influenced by the

02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:58.640
science fiction writings of the Strugatsky brothers.

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:01.920
20 years later, when Russia fell

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:05.000
apart after the end of communism, they rose up

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.720
and took control of the media.

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:11.560
And they used it to manipulate the electorate on a vast scale.

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:15.680
For them, reality was just something that

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:18.800
could be manipulated and shaped into anything

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.920
you wanted it to be.

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:37.560
GLASS THUDS

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:43.040
But then a technologist emerged who went much further.

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:44.960
And his ideas would become central to

02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.280
Putin's grip on power.

02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:51.200
He was called Vladislav Surkov.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:54.520
Surkov came originally from the theatre world and those who have

02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:57.280
studied his career say that what he did was take

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:59.800
avant-garde ideas from the theatre and bring

02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:01.840
them into the heart of politics.

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.600
Surkov's aim was not just to manipulate people

02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:09.760
but to go deeper and play with, and undermine

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:12.600
their very perception of the world so they are

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.720
never sure what is really happening.

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:23.920
Surkov turned Russian politics into

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:27.960
a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theatre.

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:29.560
He used Kremlin money to sponsor

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:34.000
all kinds of groups - from mass anti-fascist youth organisations,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.560
to the very opposite - neo-Nazi skinheads.

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:42.080
And liberal human rights groups who

02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:44.320
then attacked the government.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:47.120
Surkov even backed whole political parties that were

02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:49.000
opposed to President Putin.

02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:54.720
But the key thing was that Surkov then let it be known that this

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.760
was what he was doing.

02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:59.960
Which meant that no-one was sure what was real or what was fake

02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:01.000
in modern Russia.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.760
As one journalist put it,

02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.200
"It's a strategy of power that keeps any opposition

02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:09.840
"constantly confused -

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.840
"a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable

02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:15.720
"because it is indefinable."

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.400
Meanwhile, real power was elsewhere -

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:24.960
hidden away behind the stage,

02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:28.120
exercised without anyone seeing it.

02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:36.920
And then the same thing seemed to start happening in the West.

02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:40.600
By now it was becoming ever more clear

02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.040
that the system had deep flaws.

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:45.640
Every month there were new revelations,

02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:49.440
of most of the banks' involvement in global corruption,

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.520
of massive tax avoidance by all the major corporations,

02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:55.240
of the secret surveillance of everyone's e-mails

02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:57.920
by the National Security Agency.

02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:00.400
Yet no-one was prosecuted,

02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.200
except for a few people at the lowest levels.

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:05.880
And behind it all,

02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:08.640
the massive inequality kept on growing.

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.760
Yet the structure of power remained the same.

02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:14.960
Nothing ever changed -

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.160
because nothing could be allowed to destabilise the system.

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.600
But then the shape-shifting began.

02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:25.000
CHEERING

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.280
Thank you very much. So nice.

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:30.880
So amazing. So amazing.

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.040
- WOMAN:
- We love you.
- What? That's OK.

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.400
I love you more, OK?

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:35.880
CHEERING

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:37.760
The campaign that Donald Trump ran

02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:40.440
was unlike anything before in politics.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:41.920
Nothing was fixed.

02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:44.040
What he said, who he attacked

02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:49.480
and how he attacked them was constantly changing and shifting.

02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.320
Trump attacked his Republican rivals

02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.960
as all being part of a broken and corrupt system -

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:58.080
a politics where everyone could be bought,

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.360
using words that could have come from the Occupy movement.

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:05.280
You've also donated to several Democratic candidates,

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.800
Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.

02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.840
You explained away those donations saying you did that

02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:13.200
to get business-related favours.

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.640
And you said recently, "When you give,

02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.840
"they do whatever the hell you want them to do."

02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:22.200
- You'd better believe it.
- So what specifically did they do?

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.600
If I ask them, if I need them...

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:26.480
You know, most of the people on this stage,

02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.320
I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.800
I will tell you that our system is broken.

02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:33.760
I give to many people.

02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:36.160
Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman.

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:38.720
I give to everybody. When they call, I give.

02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:41.360
And you know what, when I need something from them,

02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:43.880
two years later, three years later, I call them.

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:47.240
- They are there for me.
- So what did you get?
- And that's a broken system.

02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:50.440
But at the same time, Trump used the language

02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:53.520
of the extreme racist right in America,

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.960
connecting with people's darkest fears -

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.560
pushing them and bringing those fears out into the open.

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.800
Get the fuck out of here!

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.240
Our country, motherfucker!

02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.760
Our country!

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:07.400
Proud fucking American!

02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:09.040
Made in the USA, bitch!

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:11.720
Made in the fucking USA!

02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:14.120
Don't fucking come back, burrito bitch!

02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:19.920
Go fucking right back to jail, motherfucker!

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.920
Build that fucking wall for me!

02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:25.240
Trump! Donald Trump!

02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:27.720
Fuck you! I love my country!

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:30.920
Yeah! I'll fuck like at least ten of you up in one session,

02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:32.760
you fucking pussy!

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:35.600
Many of the facts that Trump asserted

02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:37.840
were also completely untrue.

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:39.960
But Trump didn't care.

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.920
He and his audience knew that much of what he said

02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:45.120
bore little relationship to reality.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:49.800
This meant that Trump defeated journalism -

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.160
because the journalists' central belief was that

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:56.360
their job was to expose lies and assert the truth.

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.520
With Trump, this became irrelevant.

02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:04.000
Not surprisingly, Vladimir Putin admired this.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.280
MAN SPEAKS RUSSIAN

02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:55.600
The liberals were outraged by Trump.

02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:58.440
But they expressed their anger in cyberspace,

02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.120
so it had no effect -

02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:03.640
because the algorithms made sure that they only spoke to people

02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:05.200
who already agreed with them.

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:10.800
Instead, ironically, their waves of angry messages and tweets

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.840
benefitted the large corporations who ran the social media platforms.

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:21.000
One online analyst put it simply, "Angry people click more."

02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:27.080
It meant that the radical fury

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:29.480
that came like waves across the internet

02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:32.880
no longer had the power to change the world.

02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:35.600
Instead, it was becoming a fuel

02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:38.400
that was feeding the new systems of power

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:40.400
and making them ever more powerful.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.800
But none of the liberals could possibly imagine

02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:50.520
that Donald Trump could ever win the nomination.

02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.000
It was just a giant pantomime.

02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:58.520
Then of course there's Donald Trump.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.960
Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president

02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:02.920
as a Republican, which is surprising,

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.040
since I just assumed he was running as a joke.

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:08.560
LAUGHTER

02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:16.840
Donald Trump often appears on Fox, which is ironic,

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:19.760
because a fox often appears on Donald Trump's head.

02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:21.320
LAUGHTER

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:29.640
Donald Trump owns the Miss USA Pageant,

02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:31.240
which is great for Republicans

02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:33.880
because it will streamline their search for a vice president.

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.400
LAUGHTER

02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:44.480
Donald Trump said recently he has a great relationship with the blacks.

02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:47.200
though unless the Blacks are a family of white people,

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:49.640
I bet he's mistaken.

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:51.080
LAUGHTER

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:03.320
But underneath the liberal disdain,

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:07.640
both Donald Trump in America, and Vladislav Surkov in Russia

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:09.920
had realised the same thing -

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:13.520
that the version of reality that politics presented

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:15.680
was no longer believable,

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:19.400
that the stories politicians told their people about the world

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.120
had stopped making sense.

02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:25.920
And in the face of that, you could play with reality,

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:28.800
constantly shifting and changing,

02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:31.960
and in the process, further undermine and weaken

02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:33.800
the old forms of power.

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.640
CHILDREN SING

02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:03.880
And there was another force that was about to dramatically reveal

02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:07.200
just how weak politics had become in the West -

02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:08.560
Syria.

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:10.560
CHILDREN SING

02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:34.400
The attack happened here at a central police station

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:35.800
in Damascus.

02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:39.160
Police say the bomber came up the stairs,

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:41.720
police then opened fire,

02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:44.840
and then police say he detonated the explosives.

02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:46.600
And the damage is here to see.

02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.560
Behind me, the pockmarked walls where the ball bearings hit.

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:55.040
Blood splattered on the walls.

02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:59.040
And the force of the blast caused walls to collapse.

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:03.760
And everything is topsy-turvy, everything destroyed.

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:14.040
By now Syria was being torn apart by a horrific civil war.

02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:16.960
What had started as part of the Arab Spring

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.680
had turned into a vicious battle to the death

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:23.000
between Bashar Assad and his opponents.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.960
And at the heart of the conflict

02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:28.440
was the force that his father had first brought to the West -

02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:30.680
suicide bombing.

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:32.760
THEY SPEAK IN OWN LANGUAGE

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:37.840
Back in the 1980s

02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:41.080
Bashar Assad's father had seen suicide bombing

02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:42.920
as a weapon he could use

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.480
to force the Americans out of the Middle East.

02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.880
But over the next 30 years it had shifted and mutated

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:53.320
into something that had now ended up doing the very opposite -

02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:55.720
tearing the Arab world apart.

02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:03.720
Hafez al-Assad's dream of a powerful and united Arab world

02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.440
was now destroyed.

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:10.000
In Iraq, extremist Sunni groups had used suicide bombing

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.520
as a way to start a sectarian war.

02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:18.560
And now groups like Isis brought the same techniques into Syria

02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.160
to attack not just Assad's son but his fellow Shi'ites.

02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:32.120
And like his father, Bashar Assad retaliated

02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.160
with a vengeful fury.

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.960
And the country fell apart.

02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.520
- MAN:
- Allahu Akbar.

02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:42.040
WHOOSHING

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.760
Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.

02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:58.080
ROARING

02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:05.200
My fellow Americans...

02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:08.200
tonight I want to talk to you about Syria -

02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.720
why it matters and where we go from here.

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:16.680
Faced by the war, western politicians were bewildered.

02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:20.400
They insisted Bashar Assad was evil.

02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:23.920
But then it turned out that his enemies were more evil

02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:25.680
and more horrific than him.

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:27.840
The question before the House today

02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:30.880
is how we keep the British people safe from the threat

02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.520
posed by Isil.

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:36.000
This is not about whether we want to fight terrorism,

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.720
it's about how best we do that.

02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:41.680
So Britain, America and France

02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:45.240
decided to bomb the terrorist threat.

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.600
But the effect of that was to help keep Assad in power.

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:51.920
WHOOSHING

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.320
CLATTERING

02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.000
Then it became more confusing.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.920
Suddenly, the Russians intervened.

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:05.280
President Putin sent hundreds of planes and combat troops

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.720
to support Assad.

02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:11.840
But no-one knew what their underlying aim was.

02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.160
They seemed to be using a strategy that

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:16.960
Vladislav Surkov had developed in the Ukraine.

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:20.880
He called it non-linear warfare.

02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:24.200
It was a new kind of war - where you never know

02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:26.520
what the enemy are really up to.

02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:28.760
- MAN:
- Allahu Akbar.

02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:32.640
The underlying aim, Surkov said, was not to win the war,

02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:35.720
but to use the conflict to create a constant state

02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:37.800
of destabilised perception -

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:40.520
in order to manage and control.

02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:42.480
MAN BREATHES HEAVILY

02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:44.840
Allahu Akbar.

02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.880
ORCHESTRA PLAYS

02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:54.640
In March 2016 the Russians suddenly announced with a great fanfare

02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.000
that they were leaving Syria.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
And a concert was held in the ruins of Palmyra

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.640
to celebrate the withdrawal.

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:07.480
But in reality, the Russians never left.

02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:08.680
They are still there,

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:12.040
and still no-one knows what they want.

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:14.160
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:25.080
And within Syria there was a new Islamist ideologist

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:28.240
who was determined to exploit the growing uncertainties

02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:30.600
in Europe and America.

02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:33.720
He was called Abu Musab al-Suri -

02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:35.720
the Syrian.

02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:39.360
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.600
Al-Suri had originally worked with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan,

02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:52.320
but he had turned against him.

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:55.080
Al-Suri gave lectures that had a powerful effect

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.560
on the Islamist movement.

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.720
He argued that bin Laden had been wrong

02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:01.640
to attack the West head on,

02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:04.600
because it created a massive military response

02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:07.880
that had almost destroyed Islamism.

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.880
Instead, al-Suri said,

02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:12.360
independent groups or individuals

02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:15.280
should stage random, small-scale attacks

02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:17.920
on civilians in Europe and America.

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:20.080
The aim was to spread fear,

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:22.360
uncertainty and doubt -

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:26.320
and undermine the already failing authority of western politicians.

02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.560
The effect of the attacks shocked Europe and America

02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.640
and gave powerful force to the new politics of uncertainty and anxiety.

02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.840
I'm sure that you, with me,

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:04.080
share the absolute horror and total revulsion

02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:07.440
at what happened in Paris last Friday.

02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:09.200
And I'm afraid there is,

02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:12.000
and we have to be honest and frank about this

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.320
and talk about these things without being fearful,

02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:21.960
there is a problem with some of the Muslim community in this country.

02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:24.480
There is a problem. And we have to be honest about it.

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:27.520
Our politicians, I'm afraid, haven't had the guts.

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:31.360
APPLAUSE

02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:34.160
This could be the great Trojan horse of all time,

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:37.840
because you look at the migration... Study it, look at it.

02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:40.680
Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:43.840
Both the Brexit campaign in Britain

02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:45.720
and Donald Trump in America

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:48.600
did exactly what al-Suri had predicted.

02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:51.920
They used the fear to dramatise a world where everything -

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:55.240
even going to a restaurant - had become a risky event.

02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:00.560
And what had been seen as doomed campaigns on the fringes of society

02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:03.040
that could never win became frighteningly real.

02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:08.440
I am genuinely freaked out right now about this whole Brexit thing.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.400
Because we'd all been told that it wasn't going to happen,

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.960
like it was going away, it was going away from Brexiting

02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:15.440
and on to the staying.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:18.440
And because I had this, like bedrock belief...

02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:20.960
I have friends who, like, live and work in London,

02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.400
and they said, "Don't worry, we're a very sensible people."

02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:25.560
LAUGHTER

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.640
"This isn't going to happen. It's a lot of talk,

02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:29.800
"but we don't do that sort of stuff here."

02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.280
Um...they were wrong.

02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.840
LAUGHTER

02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:38.840
And that really kind of crushes my view of,

02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:40.560
like, what can happen that is bad

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.680
that we don't think is going to happen.

02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:44.600
Like it's just not supposed to happen.

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.320
CROWD GASPS

02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.040
CLANKING

02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.360
DRIPPING

02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:02.040
CLANKING

02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.120
I fear that we are watching

02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.640
the stirrings of fascism in Europe again.

02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.520
And I genuinely never thought it would be my country

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:16.880
that did that.

02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.960
I thought this would be America.

I thought America was the people who were so filled with hate.

02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:24.160
Not us.

02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.480
And I'm so disappointed.

02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:30.280
I'm so hurt.

02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:36.320

# You must think my bed's a bus stop

02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:02.960
# The way you come and go HE COUGHS

02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:07.240
# I ain't seen you with the lights on

02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:12.240
# Two nights in a row

02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.880
# So pack your rusty razor

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:22.760
# Don't bother with goodbye

02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.520
# Your cup runneth open

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:35.240
# But mine is always dry

02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.280
# Don't help me set the table

02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:10.120
# Cos now there's one less place

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:17.120
# I won't lay Mama's silver

02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:21.520
# For a man who won't say grace

02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:25.520
# If home is where the heart is... #

02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:27.840
This is my right to free speech going on here, OK?

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:32.320
# Then your home's on the streets

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.760
# Me, I'll read a good book

02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:43.480
